    "keywords": "Improve this Doc By default, the Orleans scheduler requires an activation to completely finish processing one request before invoking the next request. An activation cannot receive a new request until all of the Task s created (directly or indirectly) in the processing of the current request have been resolved and all of their associated closures executed. Grain implementation classes may be marked with the [Reentrant] attribute to indicate that turns belonging to different requests may be freely interleaved. In other words, a reentrant activation may start executing another request while a previous request has not finished processing and has pending closures. Execution of turns of both requests are still limited to a single thread. So the activation is still executing one turn at a time, and each turn is executing on behalf of only one of the activation’s requests. Reentrant grain code will never run multiple pieces of grain code in parallel (execution of grain code will always be single-threaded), but reentrant grains may see the execution of code for different requests interleaving. That is, the continuation turns from different requests may interleave. For example, with the below pseudo-code, when Foo and Bar are 2 methods of the same grain class: Task Foo() { await task1; // line 1 return Do2(); // line 2 } Task Bar() { await task2; // line 3 return Do2(); // line 4 } If this grain is marked [Reentrant] , the execution of Foo and Bar may interleave. For example, the following order of execution is possible: Line 1, line 3, line 2 and line 4. That is, the turns from different requests interleave. If the grain was not reentrant, the only possible executions would be: line 1, line 2, line 3, line 4 OR: line 3, line 4, line 1, line 2 (new request cannot start before the previous one finished). Reentrant grains should have slightly less overhead because of fewer activations, scheduling queues, smaller directory, and resources proportional to the number of activations. How small or large the “slightly” depends on what order of numbers we are talking about here, and on the potential overhead of handling interleaving requests (extra copies of state, etc.). The main tradeoff in choosing between reentrant and non-reentrant grains is the code complexity to make interleaving work correctly and the difficulty to reason about it. In a trivial case when the grains are stateless and the logic is simple, fewer (but not too few, so that all the hardware threads are used) reentrant grains should be in general slightly more efficient. If the code is more complex, then a larger number of non-reentrant grains, even if slightly less efficient overall, should save you a lot of grief of figuring out non-obvious interleaving issues. In the end answer will depend on the specifics of the application."

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Orleans provides a way to intercept grain invocation calls and inject an arbitrary application logic into the invocation path. We currectly support only client side pre-call inteceptors. Client side interceptors If client side interceptor is defined, any grain call made from Orleans client will invoke this interceptor before the call is dispatched remotely. The interceptor is invoked synchronously in the same thread where the call is made after call arguments were deep copied. Since the interceptor is invoked synchronously it should return promptly and do a minimum work, to avoid blocking calling thread or impacting throughput. The interceptor is allowed to mutate the call arguments and also mutate the Orleans.RequestContext . Any changes made by the interceptor to Orleans.RequestContext will be picked up as part of the call dispatch logic that occurs after the interceptor. If the interceptor logic throws an exception, the remote call will not be made and the client calling code will throw promptly. The interceptor can be set by setting GrainClient.ClientInvokeCallback , which is a property of type Action<InvokeMethodRequest, IGrain> . The first argument is the invocation request that includes varios details about the invoked call, such as InterfaceId and MethodId, as well as deep-copied arguments. The second argument is the target grain reference to which this call is made. Currently, the main scenario that we know of that uses client side pre-call inteceptors is to add some extra information to Orleans.RequestContext , such as any special call context or token. Server side interceptors We currently do not have an implemention of server side interceptors (pre and post grain side interceptors). Talk to us if you think you have a scenario where this would be usefull. We also envision client side post-call interceptor."

    "title": "External Tasks and Grains | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc By design, any sub-Tasks spawned from grain code (for example, by using await or ContinueWith or Task.Factory.StartNew ) will be dispatched on the same per-activation TPL Task Scheduler as the parent task and therefore inherit the same single-threaded execution model as the rest of grain code. This is the main point behind single threaded execution of grain turn based concurency . In some cases grain code might need to “break out” of the Orleans task scheduling model and “do something special”, such as explicitly pointing a Task to a different task scheduler or using the .NET Thread pool. Example of such cases may be when the grain code has to execute a synchronous remote blocking call (such as remote IO). Doing that in the grain context will block the grain as well as one of the Orleans threads and thus should never be made. Instead, the grain code can execute this piece of blocking code on the thread pool thread and join ( await ) the completion of that execution and proceed in the grain context. We expect that escaping from Orleans scheduler will be a very advanced and seldom required usage scenario beyond the “normal” usage patterns. Task based APIs: 1) await , Task.Factory.StartNew , Task.ContinuewWith , Task.WhenAny , Task.WhenAll , Task.Delay all respect the current Task Scheduler. That means that using them in the default way, without passing a different TaskScheduler, will cause them to execute in the grain context. 2) Both Task.Run and the endMethod delegate of Task.Factory.FromAsync do NOT respect the current task Scheduler. They both use the TaskScheduler.Default scheduler, which is the .NET thread pool task Scheduler. Therefore, the code inside Task.Run and the endMethod will ALWAYS run on .NET thread pool outside of the single-threaded execution model for Orleans grains, as detailed here . However, any code after the await Task.Run or await Task.Factory.FromAsync will run back under the scheduler at the point the task was created, which is the grain scheduler. 3) configureAwait(false) is an explicit API to escape the current task Scheduler. It will cause the code after an awaited Task to be executed on the TaskScheduler.Default scheduler, which is the .NET thread pool and will thus break the single-threaded execution of Orleans grain. You should in general never ever use configureAwait(false) directly in the grain code. 4) Methods with signature async void should not be used with grains, they are intended for graphical user interface event handlers. Example: Below is a sample code that demonstrates the usage of TaskScheduler.Current , Task.Run and a special custom scheduler to escape from Orlean grain context and how to get back to it. public async Task MyGrainMethod() { // Grab the Orleans task scheduler var orleansTs = TaskScheduler.Current; await TaskDelay(10000); // Current task scheduler did not change, the code after await is still running in the same task scheduler. Assert.AreEqual(orleansTs, TaskScheduler.Current); Task t1 = Task.Run( () => { // This code runs on the thread pool scheduler, not on Orleans task scheduler Assert.AreNotEqual(orleansTS, TaskScheduler.Current); Assert.AreEqual(TaskScheduler.Default, TaskScheduler.Current); } ); await t1; // We are back to Orleans task scheduler, since await was executed in Orleans task scheduler context we are now back to that context. Assert.AreEqual(orleansTS, TaskScheduler.Current); // Example of using ask.Factory.StartNew with a custom scheduler to escape Orleans scheduler Task t2 = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => { // This code runs on MyCustomSchedulerThatIWroteMyself scheduler, not on Orleans task scheduler Assert.AreNotEqual(orleansTS, TaskScheduler.Current); Assert.AreEqual(MyCustomSchedulerThatIWroteMyself, TaskScheduler.Current); }, CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.None, scheduler: MyCustomSchedulerThatIWroteMyself); await t2; // We are back to Orleans task scheduler. Assert.AreEqual(orleansTS, TaskScheduler.Current); } Advanced Example - making grain call from a code that runs on thread pool There is sometimes an even more advanced scenario of a piece of grain code that needs to “break out” of the Orleans task scheduling model and run on a thread pool (or some other, non-Orleans context) but still needs an ability to make a grain call to another grain. If you will just try to make a grain call not from within Orleans context, you will get an exception telling you that you are \"trying to send a message on a silo not from within grain and not from within system target (RuntimeContext is not set to SchedulingContext)\". Below is a code that demonstrates how a grain call can be made from a piece of code that runs inside a grain but not in the grain context. public async Task MyGrainMethod() { // Grab the Orleans task scheduler var orleansTs = TaskScheduler.Current; Task<int> t1 = Task.Run(async () => { // This code runs on the thread pool scheduler, not on Orleans task scheduler Assert.AreNotEqual(orleansTS, TaskScheduler.Current); // You can do what ever you need to do here. Now lets say you need to make a grain call. Task<Task<int>> t2 = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => { // This code runs on Orleans task scheduler since we specified the scheduler: orleansTs. Assert.AreEqual(orleansTS, TaskScheduler.Current); return GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFooGrain>(0).MakeGrainCall(); }, CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.None, scheduler: orleansTs); int res = await (await t2); // double await, unrelated to Orleans, just part of TPL APIs. // This code runs back on the thread pool scheduler, not on Orleans task scheduler Assert.AreNotEqual(orleansTS, TaskScheduler.Current); return res; } ); int result = await t1; // We are back to Orleans task scheduler, since await was executed in Orleans task scheduler context we are now back to that context. Assert.AreEqual(orleansTS, TaskScheduler.Current); } Dealing with libraries Some external libraries that your code is using might be using ConfigureAwait(false) internally. In fact, it is a good and correct practice in .NET to use ConfigureAwait(false) when implementing general purpose libraries . This is not a problem in Orleans. As long as the code in the grain that invokes the library method is awaiting the library call with a regular await , the grain code is correct. The result will be exactly as desired - the library code will run continuations on the Default scheduler (which happens to be ThreadPoolTaskScheduler but it does not guarantee that the continuations will definitely run on a ThreadPool thread, as continuations are often inlined in the previous thread), while the grain code will run on the Orleans scheduler. Another question that we are often asked whether there is a need to execute library calls with Task.Run - that is, whether there is a need to explicitly offload the library code to ThreadPool (for grain code to do Task.Run(()=> myLibrary.FooAsync()) ). The answer is negative. There is no need to offload any code to ThreadPool, except for the case that the library code is making a blocking synchronous calls. Usually, any well written and correct .NET async library (methods that return Task and are named with Async suffix) do not making blocking calls and thus there is really no need to offload anything to ThreadPool, unless you suspect the async library is buggy or if you are deliberately using a synchronous blocking library. Summary What are you trying to do? How to do it Run background work on .NET thread-pool threads. No grain code or grain calls allowed. Task.Run Grain interface call Method return types = Task or Task<T> Run worker task from grain code with Orleans turn-based concurrency guarantees. Task.Factory.StartNew Timeouts for executing work items Task.Delay + Task.WhenAny Use with async / await The normal .NET Task-Async programming model. Supported & recommended ConfigureAwait(false) Do not use inside grain code. Allowed only inside libraries. Calling async library await the library call"

In addition to out of the box support for Azure storage Orleans also provides an option to store this information in SQL server.

The server configuration should look like this: <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <SystemStore SystemStoreType =\"SqlServer\" DeploymentId=\"OrleansTest\" DataConnectionString=\"Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=Orleans;Integrated Security=True;Pooling=False;Max Pool Size=200;Asynchronous Processing=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True\" AdoInvariant=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /> </Globals> </OrleansConfiguration> The client configuration should look like this: <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <SystemStore SystemStoreType =\"SqlServer\" DeploymentId=\"OrleansTest\" DataConnectionString=\"Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=Orleans;Integrated Security=True;Pooling=False;Max Pool Size=200;Asynchronous Processing=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True\" AdoInvariant=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /> </ClientConfiguration> Where the DataConnectionString is set to any valid SQL Server connection string. In order to use SQL Server as the store for system data, there’s now a script file CreateOrleansTables_* (where asterisk denotes database vendor) in the Binaries\\OrleansServer folder which establishes the necessary database objects. Make sure that all servers that will be hosting Orleans silos can reach the database and has access rights to it! We’ve tripped up a few times on this seemingly trivial concern during our testing. SQL Metrics and Statistics tables System tables can currently only be stored in Azure table or SQL server. For Metrics and Statistics tables however, we provide a generic support to host it in any persistent storage. This is provided via the notion of a StatisticsProvider . Any application can write an arbitrary provider to store statistics and metrics data in a persistent store of their choice.

These bootstrap providers are C# classes that implement the Orleans.Providers.IBootstrapProvider interface. When each silo starts up, the Orleans runtime will instantiate each of the listed app bootstrap classes, and then call their Init method in an appropriate runtime execution context that allows those classes to act as a client and send messages to grains. Task Init( string name, IProviderRuntime providerRuntime, IProviderConfiguration config) Any Exceptions that are thrown from an Init method of a bootstrap provider will be reported by the Orleans runtime in the silo log, then the silo startup will be halted. This fail-fast approach is the standard way that Orleans handles silo start-up issues, and is intended to allow any problems with silo configuration and/or bootstrap logic to be easily detected during testing phases rather than being silently ignored and causing unexpected problems later in the silo lifecycle."

    "href": "Documentation/Advanced-Concepts/Activation-Garbage-Collection.html",
    "title": "Activation Garbage Collection | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc The Orleans Team often uses the phrase “Activation Garbage Collection” but that is probably a somewhat misleading term as it might imply it works the same way that .NET garbage collection does, based solely on memory-pressure triggers. In the past, we experimented with Activation-GC based on memory usage triggers, but we abandoned that approach due to the unreliable memory usage metrics we could use. We ended up implementing a simple time-based approach to Activation-GC, which seems to be working well during various high traffic stress test runs. This approach requires calculating a balance between Request-per-second Memory-per-grain Available memory in order to set the age-out limits. How Activation-GC Works The most common approach is to configure the silo to periodically scan for activations that have not been used at all for some period of time (CollectionAgeLimit). The silo then proactively ages-out those non-active activations by calling the grain’s Deactivate method and remove them from the silo memory. What counts as “being active” for the purpose of grain activation collection receiving a call receiving a reminder What does NOT count as “being active” for the purpose of grain activation collection performing a call (to another grain or to an Orleans client) timer events arbitrary IO operations or external calls not involving Orleans framework Collection Age Limit Activations that haven't been used within a period of time are deactivated automatically by the runtime. This period of time is called the collection age limit. The runtime's default collection age limit is 2 hours. Configuration Any length of time in the configuration XML file may use a suffix that specifies a unit of time: Suffix Unit none millisecond(s) ms millisecond(s) s second(s) m minute(s) hr hour(s) Specifying the Default (Global) Age Limit The default collection age limit that applies to all grain types can be customized by adding the OrleansConfiguation/Globals/Application/Defaults/Deactivation element to the OrleansConfiguration.xml file. The minimal allowed age limit is 1 minute. The following example specifies that all activations that have been idle for 10 minutes or more should be considered eligible for deactivation. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <Application> <Defaults> <Deactivation AgeLimit=\"10m\"/> </Defaults> </Application> </Globals> </OrleansConfiguration> Specifying per-Type Age Limits Individual grain types may specify a collection age limit that is independent from the global default, using the OrleansConfiguation/Globals/Application/GrainType/Deactivation element. The minimal allowed age limit is 1 minute. In the following example, activations that have been idle for 10 minutes are eligible for collection, except activations that are instantiations of the MyGrainAssembly.DoNotDeactivateMeOften class, which are not considered collectable unless idle for a full 24 hours: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <Application> <Defaults> <Deactivation AgeLimit=\"10m\"/> </Defaults> <GrainType Type=\"MyGrainAssembly.DoNotDeactivateMeOften\"> <Deactivation AgeLimit=\"24hr\"/> </GrainType> </Application> </Globals> </OrleansConfiguration> Any number of GrainType elements may be specified. Configuring Activation Garbage Collection Programmatically An activation can also impact its own activation GC, by calling the method on the Orleans.Grain base class: protected void DelayDeactivation(TimeSpan timeSpan) This call will insure that this activations is not deactivated for at least the specified time duration. It takes priority over Activation Garbage Collection settings specified in the config, but does not cancel them. Therefore, this call provides an additional hook to delay the deactivation beyond what is specified in the Activation Garbage Collection settings . This call can not be used to expedite Activation Garbage Collection. A positive timeSpan value means “prevent GC of this activation for that time span”. A negative timeSpan value means “cancel the previous setting of the DelayDeactivation call and make this activation behave based on the regular Activation Garbage Collection settings ”. Scenarios: 1) Activation Garbage Collection settings specify age limit of 10 minutes and the grain is making a call to DelayDeactivation(20 min), it will cause this activatin to not be collected for at least 20 min. 2) Activation Garbage Collection settings specify age limit of 10 minutes and the grain is making a call to DelayDeactivation(5 min), the activation will be collected after 10 min, if no extra calls were made. 3) Activation Garbage Collection settings specify age limit of 10 minutes and the grain is making a call to DelayDeactivation(5 min), and after 7 minutes there is another call on this grain, the activation will be collected after 17 min from time zero, if no extra calls were made. 4) Activation Garbage Collection settings specify age limit of 10 minutes and the grain is making a call to DelayDeactivation(20 min), and after 7 minutes there is another call on this grain, the activation will be collected after 20 min from time zero, if no extra calls were made. You can also instruct the runtime to deactivate the grain next time it becomes idle, by using: protected void DeactivateOnIdle() DeactivateOnIdle take priority over any Activation Garbage Collection settings specified in the config or DelayDeactivation . Please notice that this setting only applies to this particular activation from which it has been called and it does not apply to all possible instances of grains of this type."

GrainFactory is not a static class anymore, so that the default implementation can be substituted for testing and other reasons. Within grain code one can still use code like GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey) because Grain class now has a GrainFactory property, which makes the above code translate to base.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey) . So no change is necessary for such code. Within the client (frontend) context the default GrainFactory is available as a property on the GrainClient class. So, the code that used to be GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey) needs to be changed to GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey) 2. Read/Write/ClearStateAsync methods methods that on grain state were moved from state objects to Grain class Wherever you have grain code like this.State.WriteStateAsync() , it needs to change to this.WriteStateAsync() . Similar adjustments need to be made to usage of ReadeStateAsync() and CleareStateAsync() . 3. Binaries have been removed from the Orleans SDK If your projects still reference those binaries directly from the SDK folder, you need to switch to using NuGet packages instead. If you are already consuming Orleans via NuGet, you are good. 4. Local Silo test environment has been removed from the Orleans SDK If you were using the Local Silo environment from the SDK folder for testing your grains, you need to add a silo host project to your solution using the \"Orleans Dev/Test Host\" Visual Studio project template. Before you do that, make sure you install the v1.0.9 version of the SDK . Refer to samples for examples of how that is done. Release notes Graceful shutdown of a silo with deactivation of all grains hosted in it. Support for Dependency Injection and better testability of grains: Direct instantiation of grains with passing IGrainIdentity and IGrainRuntime to constructor. IGrainRuntime is a mockable interface that includes a set of system service interfaces, also mockable. GrainFactory is a non-static class that is accessed via base.GrainFactory from within a grain and via GrainClient.GrainFactory on the client. Deprecated generated per-interface GetGrain() static factory methods. Added support for concrete grain state classes, deprecated grain state interfaces and code generation of grain classes. Removed Read/Write/ClearStateAsync methods from IGrainState and moved them to Grain<T> . Performance optimizations of messaging with up to 40% improvements in throughput. Added ZooKeeper based cluster membership storage option. Removed compile time dependency on Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime.dll. Consolidated dependencies on Azure in OrleansAzureUtils.dll, which is now optional. Refactored SQL system store to be more robust and vendor agnostic. Added streaming event deliver policy and failure reporting. Changed VS project templates to use only NuGet packages and not the SDK. Removed binaries and local silo environment from the SDK. Numerous bug fixes and other improvements. v1.0.8 May 26th 2015 Release notes Fixed versions of references Orleans NuGet packages to match the current one. Switched message header keys from strings to enums for performance. Fixed a deadlock issue in deactivation process. Added a NuGet package to simplify testing of grain projects - Microsoft.Orleans.TestingHost. Fixed regression of reporting codegen error to Visual Studio Errors window. Added version to SDK msi product and folder name. Other fixes and improvements. Community Virtual Meetup #5 Gabriel Kliot on the new Orleans Streaming API May 22nd 2015 v1.0.7 May 15th 2015 Release notes Major refactoring of the stream adapter API. Improvements to the streaming API to support subscription multiplicity. Made IAddressable.AsReference strongly-typed. Added a Chocolatey package. Added support for private storage keys for testing. Replaced ExtendedPrimaryKeyAttribute with IGrainWithGuidCompoundKey and IGrainWithIntegerCompoundKey. Added support for grain classes that are implementations of generic grain interfaces with concrete type arguments. Numerous other fixes and improvements. Community Virtual Meetup #4 Reuben Bond on using Orleans at FreeBay April 15th 2015 v1.0.5 March 30th 2015 Release notes Major reorganization of NuGet packages and project templates. Fixes to reflection-only assembly inspection and loading for side-by-side versioning. Improved scalability of observers. Programmatic configuration of providers. Numerous other fixes and improvements.

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Orleans is a framework that provides a straightforward approach to building distributed high-scale computing applications, without the need to learn and apply complex concurrency or other scaling patterns. It was created by Microsoft Research and designed for use in the cloud. Orleans has been used extensively in Microsoft Azure by several Microsoft product groups, most notably by 343 Industries as a platform for all of Halo Reach, Halo 4 and Halo 5 cloud services, as well as by a number of other companies. Following Orleans' release as an open source framework on January 2015, it has quickly gained popularity and recognition. Leveraging an active developer community and the dedication of the Orleans team, features are added and improved on a daily basis. Microsoft Research continues to invest in Orleans, making it the framework of choice for .NET distributed development. Background Cloud applications and services are inherently parallel and distributed. They are also interactive and dynamic; often requiring near real time direct interactions between cloud entities. Such applications are very difficult to build today. The development process demands expert level programmers and typically requires expensive iterations of the design and the architecture, as the workload grows. Most of today’s high scale properties are built with the SOA paradigm. Rendering of a single web page by Amazon or Google or Facebook involves complex interactions of hundreds of SOA services that are independently built, deployed and managed. The fact that each individual service scales well by itself does not guarantee scalability of a composition of such services. The data scale-out mechanism of SOA is partitioning. As data size and load grow and “hot spots” come and go, a service has to dynamically repartition its state and do so without interrupting its operation. SOA challenges the programmer with a high degree of concurrency of requests within partitions. But existing tools do not provide good support for safe and efficient concurrency and distributed parallelism. The stateless N-tier model delegates the partitioning problem to the storage layer. It often requires caching in the stateless layer to get acceptable performance, adding complexity and introducing cache consistency issues. Actors The actor model supports fine-grain individual objects—actors—that are isolated from each other and light-weight enough to allow modeling of an individual entity as an actor. They communicate via asynchronous message passing, which enables direct communications between actors. Significantly, an actor executes with single-threaded semantics. Coupled with encapsulation of the actor’s state and isolation from other actors, this simplifies writing highly concurrent systems by removing data races from the actor’s code level. Developers using actors do not have to worry about critical regions, mutexes, lock leveling, and other complex race-prevention concerns that have nothing to do with the actual application logic. Actors are dynamically created within the pool of available hardware resources. This makes balancing of load easier compared to hash-based partitioning of SOA. For the last decade, Erlang has been the most popular implementation of the traditional actor model. Facing the above-mentioned challenges of SOA, the industry started rediscovering the actor model, which stimulated renewed interest in Erlang and creation of new Erlang-like solutions: Scala actors, Akka, DCell. Virtual Actors Orleans is an implementation of an improved actor model that borrows heavily from Erlang and distributed objects systems, adds static typing, message indirection and actor virtualization, exposing them in an integrated programming model. Whereas Erlang is a pure functional language with its own custom VM, the Orleans programming model directly leverages .NET and its object-oriented capabilities. It provides a framework that makes development of complex distributed applications much easier and make the resulting applications scalable by design. Unlike actors in other systems such as Erlang or Akka, Orleans Grains are virtual actors. They communicate via asynchronous messaging, which differs greatly from synchronous method calls, but experience has shown that purely synchronous systems do not scale well; in this case we have traded familiarity for scalability. The Orleans runtime manages the location and activation of grains similarly to the way that the virtual memory manager of an operating system manages memory pages: it activates a grain by creating an in-memory copy (an activation) on a server (an Orleans Silo ), and later it may deactivate that activation if it hasn't been used for some time. If a message is sent to the grain and there is no activation on any server, then the runtime will pick a location and create a new activation there. Because grains are virtual, they never fail, even if the server that currently hosts all of their activations fails. This eliminates the need to test to see if a grain exists, as well as the need to track failures and recreate grains as needed; the Orleans runtime does all this automatically.

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Does Microsoft support Orleans? Source code of Orleans has been released under an MIT license on GitHub . Microsoft continues to invest in Orleans and accepts community contributions to the codebase. Can I get a \"Go Live\" License? The source code has been releases under the MIT license . When will Orleans be production ready? Orleans has been production ready and used in production for several years. When should I use a grain and when should I use a plain old object? There are two ways to answer this, from a runtime behavior perspective, and from a modeling perspective. The runtime behavior perspective is that an object can only be created within a grain and is not remotely accessible. Grains are accessible from anywhere in the system and are location-transparent, so that they can be automatically placed on any server in the deployment, and they survive failures or reboots of servers. The modeling perspective : there are four kinds of \"things\" in your Orleans-based application: communication interfaces, message payloads, grains, and data held privately by grains. Objects should be used for payloads and data held by grains; communication interfaces are regular interfaces with some minor restrictions. The question that remains, then, is what entities in a given system should be modeled as grains? Generally, you should use a grain to model an independent entity which has a publicly exposed communication interface with other components of the system and that has a life of its own – that is, it can exist independently from other components. For example, a user in social network is a grain, while it's name is not. A user’s news wall may be a grain, while the list of the messages it received is not (since the wall is accessible by other users, while the list of messages is a private data to that user only). Hopefully, the samples on this site will help you identify some of the patterns and see parallels to your own scenarios. How should you avoid grain hot spots? The throughput of a grain is limited by a single thread that its activation can execute on. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid designs where a single grain receives a disproportionate share of requests. There are various patterns that help prevent overloading of a single grain even when logically it is a central point of communication. For example, if a grain is an aggregator of some counters or statistics that are reported by a large number of grains on a regular basis, one proven approach is to add a controlled number of intermediate aggregator grains and assign each of the reporting grains (using a modulo on a key or a hash) to an intermediate aggregator, so that the load is more or less evenly distributed across all intermediate aggregator grains that in their turn periodically report partial aggregates to the central aggregator grain. How do I tear down a grain? In general there is no need for application logic to force deactivation of a grain, as the Orleans runtime automatically detects and deactivates idle activations of a grain to reclaim system resources. In rare cases when you think you do need to expedite deactivation of a grain, the grain can do that by calling the base.DeactivateOnIdle() method. Can I tell Orleans where to activate a grain? It is possible to do so using restrictive placement strategies, but we generally consider this an anti-pattern, so it is not recommended. If you find yourself needing to specify a specific silo for grain activation, you are likely not modeling your system to take full advantage of Orleans. By doing what the question suggests, the application would take on the burden of resource management without necessarily having enough information about the global state of the system to do so well. This is especially counter-productive in cases of silo restarts, which in cloud environments may happen on a regular basis for OS patching. Thus, specific placement may have a negative impact on your application's scalability as well as resilience to system failure. Can a single deployment run across multiple data centers? Orleans deployments are currently limited to a single data center per deployment. Can I hot deploy grains either adding or updating them? No, not currently. How do you version grains? Orleans currently does not support updating grain code on the fly. To upgrade to a new version of grain code, you need to provision and start a new deployment, switch incoming traffic to it, and then shut down the old deployment. Can I persist a grain’s state to the Azure cache service? This can be done though a storage provider for Azure Cache. We don’t have one but you can easily build your own. Can I Connect to Orleans silos from the public internet? Orleans is designed to be hosted as the back-end part of a service and you are suposed to create a front-end in your servers which externa clients connect to. It can be an http based Web API project, a socket server, a SignalR server or anything else which you require. You can actually connect to Orleans from the internet, but it is not a good practice from the security point of view. What happens if a silo fails before my grain call returns a response for my call? You'll receive an exception which you can catch and retry or do anything else which makes sense in your application logic. The Orleans runtime does not immediately recreate grains from a failed silo because many of them may not be needed immediately or at all. Instead, the runtime recreates such grains individually and only when a new request arrives for a particular grain. For each grain it picks one of the available silos as a new host. The benefit of this approach is that the recovery process is performed only for grains that are actually being used and it is spread in time and across all available silos, which improves the responsiveness of the system and the speed of recovery. Note also that there is a delay between the time when a silo fails and when the Orleans cluster detects the failure. The delay is a configurable tradeoff between the speed of detection and the probability of false positives. During this transition period all calls to the grain will fail, but after the detection of the failure the grain will be created, upon a new call to it, on another silo, so it will be eventually available. More information can be found here . What happens if a grain call takes too much time to execute? Since Orleans uses a cooperative multi-tasking model, it will not preempt the execution of a grain automatically but Orleans generates warnings for long executing grain calls so you can detect them. Cooperative multi-tasking has a much better throughput compared to preemptive multi-tasking. You should keep in mind that grain calls should not execute any long running tasks like IO synchronously and should not block on other tasks to complete. All waiting should be done asynchronously using the await keyword or other asynchronous waiting mechanisms. Grains should return as soon as possible to let other grains execute for maximum throughput. In what cases can a split brain (same grain activated in multiple silos at the same time) happen? This can never happen during normal operations and each grain will have one and only one instance per ID. The only time this can occur is when a silo crashes or if it's killed without being allowed to properly shutdown. In that case there is a 30-60 seconds window (based on configuration) where a grain can exist in multiple silos before one is removed from the system. The mapping from grain IDs to their activation (instance) addresses is stored in a distributed directory (implemented with DHT) and each silo owns a partition of this directory. When membership views of two silos differ, both can request creation of an instance and as a result. two instances of the grain may co-exist. Once the cluster silos reach an agreement on membership, one of the instances will be deactivated and only one activation will survive. You can find out more about how Orleans manages the clusters at Cluster Management page. Also you can take a look at Orleans's paper for a more detailed information, however you don't need to understand it fully to be able to write your application code. You just need to consider the rare possibility of having two instances of an actor while writing your application."

    "title": "Deployment and Versioning of Dependencies | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Orleans Dependencies Orleans currently references the following external dependencies. Windows Azure SDK 2.4 (several NuGet packages), although Orleans can run outside of Azure and with no run time dependency on it. Newtonsoft.Json 5.0.8 The exact versions of the dependencies will change over time. We will use the current versions to illustrate the deployment and versioning options. The general rule we are trying to follow with regards to Azure SDK is to target it's version current-1, to make transition to new versions of it easier. As of this writing the current version is 2.5, and hence we target 2.4. Versioning of Orleans dependencies A typical use case is when you need to run Orleans, silo or client, with a different version of a dependent library, for example with Azure SDK 2.5. In this scenario, Orleans works just like any other .NET library being subject to assembly binding redirect rules. All you need to do is to add a set of binding redirect settings to the app.config file of the process. Here's an example of an app.config that redirects Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage and Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage to the versions included in Azure SDK 2.5 and Azure Newtonsoft.Json to version 6.0.0.0. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <runtime> <assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <dependentAssembly> <assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" culture=\"neutral\" /> <bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-4.3.0.0\" newVersion=\"4.3.0.0\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly> <assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" culture=\"neutral\" /> <bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-2.5.0.0\" newVersion=\"2.5.0.0\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly> <assemblyIdentity name=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" publicKeyToken=\"30ad4fe6b2a6aeed\" culture=\"neutral\" /> <bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"0.0.0.0-6.0.0.0\" newVersion=\"6.0.0.0\" /> </dependentAssembly> </assemblyBinding> </runtime> </configuration> Grain assemblies deployed to subfolder The recommended way to deploy application code, grain assemblies and their dependencies, is to put them to a subfolder of the Applications folder. This approach provides a clear separation of application code from the Orleans runtime code and allows for additional flexibility with dependencies. You can (but don't have to) have some of the same assemblies that are already present in the main Orleans folder but of different versions. For example, if your code depends on a library that is incompatible with, say, Azure Storage 4.3, you can simply put a compatible version of Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.dll (and its dependencies) into your application folder. In that case, the two versions will be loaded by the CLR side by side. Grain assemblies deployed to main folder If for some reason deploying grain assemblies into a subfolder is not an option, and you have to deploy grain assemblies into the main folder, you are obviously limited to just one set of dependency assemblies. So you need to choose a set of versions that are compatible with both the Orleans runtime and your grain code. If necessary, you can specified assembly binding redirects as in the example above."

These examples assume you are using the latest v1.0.3 NuGet packages from Feb-2015. For simplicity I will use \"v0.9\" to refer to the \"old\" .csproj and \"v1.0\" to refer to the \"new\" .csproj although strictly speaking \"v1.0 really means \">= v1.0.3\" in practice because there was significant restructuring and changes in the Orleans NuGet packages before that point. Grain Interface Project Orleans Grain Interface project -- Example: HelloWorldInterfaces.csproj You might want to preserve a copy of the old .csproj file before you start, if you do not have a copy already preserved in your source code control system. Steps to to change Orleans Grain Interface project: Do Build->Clean on the project to remove any old binaries. Remove old v0.9 assembly references for any Orleans binaries. <ItemGroup> <Reference Include=\"Orleans\"> <HintPath>$(OrleansSDK)\\Binaries\\OrleansClient\\Orleans.dll</HintPath> <Private>False</Private> </Reference> </ItemGroup> Remove old v0.9 Orleans code-gen metadata and script trigger. <PropertyGroup> <OrleansProjectType>Server</OrleansProjectType> </PropertyGroup> <Import Project=\"$(OrleansSDK)\\Binaries\\OrleansClient\\Orleans.SDK.targets\" /> Make sure to re-save the .csproj to disk at this point, otherwise the next step will fail ! Use Visual Studio Package manager to add the Microsoft.Orleans.Templates.Interfaces package to the grain interfaces project. Do this by right-click on project node in Solution Explorer, select \"Manage NuGet Packages...\" context menu item, then search for Orleans and select the Microsoft.Orleans.Templates.Interfaces package. This will add a packages.config file to the project, and add the normal NuGet link code into the .csproj This will also add the Orleans assembly references into the project, and recreate the code-gen metadata and script links for you. Ensure .csproj file is saved to disk again. Do Build->Rebuild on the project to rebuild with the new packages and binaries. Going forward, you should only need to change the version number in packages.config to use a newer package -- either manually edit the packages.config file or use NuGet Package Manager UI in Visual Studio. Orleans Grain Class project -- Example: HelloWorldGrains.csproj Steps to to change Orleans Grain Class project: Steps 1..4 and 6..8 are the same as for the grain interfaces .csproj above. Build->Clean Remove old v0.9 Orleans assembly references Remove old v0.9 Orleans code-gen metadata Save .csproj file to disk Use Visual Studio Package manager to add the Microsoft.Orleans.Templates.Grains package to the project. Follow Steps 6..8 from the grain interfaces .csproj above. Problems? If you have problems getting these conversions to work for you, then please post a full copy of your .csproj into a Gist on your GitHub account and then open a new Issue in the Orleans GitHub Project asking for assistance and pointing to the Gist for your specific project file."

    "href": "Documentation/Benefits.html",
    "title": "Main Benefits | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc The main benefits of Orleans are: developer productivity , even for non-expert programmers; and transparent scalability by default with no special effort from the programmer. We expand on each of these benefits below. Developer Productivity The Orleans programming model raises productivity of both expert and non-expert programmers by providing the following key abstractions, guarantees and system services. Familiar object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm . Actors are .NET classes that implement declared .NET actor interfaces with asynchronous methods. Thus actors appear to the programmer as remote objects whose methods can be directly invoked. This provides the programmer the familiar OOP paradigm by turning method calls into messages, routing them to the right endpoints, invoking the target actor’s methods and dealing with failures and corner cases in a completely transparent way. Single-threaded execution of actors . The runtime guarantees that an actor never executes on more than one thread at a time. Combined with the isolation from other actors, the programmer never faces concurrency at the actor level, and hence never needs to use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to control access to shared data. This feature alone makes development of distributed applications tractable for non-expert programmers. Transparent activation . The runtime activates an actor as-needed, only when there is a message for it to process. This cleanly separates the notion of creating a reference to an actor, which is visible to and controlled by application code, and physical activation of the actor in memory, which is transparent to the application. In many ways, this is similar to virtual memory in that it decides when to “page out” (deactivate) or “page in” (activate) an actor; the application has uninterrupted access to the full “memory space” of logically created actors, whether or not they are in the physical memory at any particular point in time. Transparent activation enables dynamic, adaptive load balancing via placement and migration of actors across the pool of hardware resources. This features is a significant improvement on the traditional actor model, in which actor lifetime is application-managed. Location transparency . An actor reference (proxy object) that the programmer uses to invoke the actor’s methods or pass to other components only contains the logical identity of the actor. The translation of the actor’s logical identity to its physical location and the corresponding routing of messages are done transparently by the Orleans runtime. Application code communicates with actors oblivious to their physical location, which may change over time due to failures or resource management, or because an actor is deactivated at the time it is called. Transparent integration with persistent store . Orleans allows for declarative mapping of actors’ in-memory state to persistent store. It synchronizes updates, transparently guaranteeing that callers receive results only after the persistent state has been successfully updated. Extending and/or customizing the set of existing persistent storage providers available is straight-forward. Automatic propagation of errors . The runtime automatically propagates unhandled errors up the call chain with the semantics of asynchronous and distributed try/catch. As a result, errors do not get lost within an application. This allows the programmer to put error handling logic at the appropriate places, without the tedious work of manually propagating errors at each level. Transparent Scalability by Default The Orleans programming model is designed to guide the programmer down a path of likely success in scaling their application or service through several orders of magnitude. This is done by incorporating the proven best practices and patterns, and providing an efficient implementation of the lower level system functionality. Here are some key factors that enable scalability and performance. Implicit fine grain partitioning of application state . By using actors as directly addressable entities, the programmer implicitly breaks down the overall state of their application. While the Orleans programming model does not prescribe how big or small an actor should be, in most cases it makes sense to have a relative large number of actors – millions or more – with each representing a natural entity of the application, such as a user account, a purchase order, etc. With actors being individually addressable and their physical location abstracted away by the runtime, Orleans has enormous flexibility in balancing load and dealing with hot spots in a transparent and generic way without any thought from the application developer. Adaptive resource management . With actors making no assumption about locality of other actors they interact with and because of the location transparency, the runtime can manage and adjust allocation of available HW resources in a very dynamic way by making fine grain decisions on placement/migration of actors across the compute cluster in reaction to load and communication patterns without failing incoming requests. By creating multiple replicas of a particular actor the runtime can increase throughput of the actor if necessary without making any changes to the application code. Multiplexed communication . Actors in Orleans have logical endpoints, and messaging between them is multiplexed across a fixed set of all-to-all physical connections (TCP sockets). This allows the runtime to host a very large number (millions) of addressable entities with low OS overhead per actor. In addition, activation/deactivation of an actor does not incur the cost of registering/unregistering of a physical endpoint, such as a TCP port or a HTTP URL, or even closing a TCP connection. Efficient scheduling . The runtime schedules execution of a large number of single-threaded actors across a custom thread pool with a thread per physical processor core. With actor code written in the non-blocking continuation based style (a requirement of the Orleans programming model) application code runs in a very efficient “cooperative” multi-threaded manner with no contention. This allows the system to reach high throughput and run at very high CPU utilization (up to 90%+) with great stability. The fact that a growth in the number of actors in the system and the load does not lead to additional threads or other OS primitives helps scalability of individual nodes and the whole system. Explicit asynchrony . The Orleans programming model makes the asynchronous nature of a distributed application explicit and guides programmers to write non-blocking asynchronous code. Combined with asynchronous messaging and efficient scheduling, this enables a large degree of distributed parallelism and overall throughput without the explicit use of multi-threading."

    "title": "Student Projects | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Student Projects We suggest 2 types of projects for students: The first type includes exploratory, open-ended, research-oriented projects with the goal of enabling new capabilities in Orleans. These projects would usually have broad scope and would be suitable for M.S. or Ph.D. student or advanced undergraduate students in their last year of studies. The end goal of these projects would be to contribute ideas and design to Orleans. We do not necessarily expect the code produced in these projects to be directly contributed to this repository, however this would be nice. The second type includes ideas for student education . These are either ideas for interesting applications that can be built on top of Orleans or some new capabilities for Orleans. These projects are suitable to be given in advanced undergraduate or graduate courses, where students learn about Cloud Computing and modern distributed technologies and want to gain real-world hands-on experience in building Cloud applications. We do not expect the code produced in these projects to be contributed directly to this repository. Research projects: Auto-scale. In this project students can start by exploring the existing auto-scaling mechanisms for controlling resource allocation in Windows Azure ( Autoscaling Application Block ). The next step involves exploring various statistics and resource consumption metrics collected by Orleans, and using them as an input for Azure Autoscaling. An advanced stage of this project may involve improving the internal Orleans mechanisms for reacting to elasticity changes, for example by implementing live actor migration to reduce the time taken to utilize new resources. Auto-generated front-ends for Orleans-based cloud services . This project seamlessly extends the Orleans actor model into the HTTP world. The ramp-up part of the project includes dynamically generating HTTP endpoints for actors based on their .NET interfaces and metadata. The main part involves automatically generating front-ends to support web sockets and bi-directional streaming of data, which requires complex code generation with optimizations for high performance. It also requires attention to fault tolerance, to maintain high availability of streaming sessions across server reboots and client reconnects and migration -- a significant research challenge. Storage provider for Entity Framework . This project involves enabling Orleans objects to store their state in a database and to subsequently query it. This might include adding support for Orleans object persistence on SQL Azure Database using Entity Framework (EF), which is Microsoft's open-source object-relational mapper for .NET, and exposing that data via LINQ queries. The implementation can be evaluated and tuned using standard database benchmarks and/or custom Orleans' applications. Distributed system benchmark . Define a list of benchmarks suitable for distributed systems like Orleans. The benchmark applications may be analogous in spirit to the TPC database benchmark or UCB \"Parallel Dwarfs\" implemented here and may be used to characterize the performance and scalability of distributed frameworks. Consider developing a new benchmark targeted for Orleans, for example, to compare the performance of storage providers. Declarative dataflow language over streams . Define and build a Trident-Storm like declarative language over Orleans streams. Develop an optimizer that configures the stream processing to minimize overall cost. Programming model for client devices . Extend Orleans to client devices, such as sensors, phones, tablets, and desktops. Enable grain logic to execute on the client. Potentially support tier splitting, that is, dynamically deciding which parts of the code execute on the device and which is offloaded to the cloud. Queries over grain/actor classes, secondary indices . Build a distributed, scalable, and reliable grain index. This includes formally defining the query model and implementing the distributed index. The index itself can be implemented as Orleans grains and/or stored in a database. Large scale simulations . Orleans is a great fit for building large scale simulations. Explore the usage of Orleans for different simulations, for example, protein interactions, network simulations, simulated annealing, etc. Course projects: Internet Of Things applications . For example, the application could enable sensors/devices to report their state to the cloud, where each device is represented in the cloud by an Orleans actor. Users can connect to the actor that represents their device via a web browser and check its status or control it. This project involves mastering a number of modern cloud technologies, including Windows Azure , Orleans, WebApi or ASP.NET, SignalR for streaming commands back from the cloud to the device, and writing a sensor/device/phone app. Twitter-like large scalable chat service in the cloud based on Orleans . Each user could be represented by an Orleans Actor, which contains its list of followers. Faceboook-like social app based on Orleans . Each user could be represented by an Orleans Actor, which includes a list of friends and wall on which friends can write. Simple storage provider . Add a storage provider for a storage system, such as a key-value store or database system. A simple one could use the Orleans serializer , as in the existing Azure Table storage provider . A more sophisticated one would map state variables of an Orleans class to fine-grained structures of the storage system. A complex one is the Entity Framework storage provider mentioned above under Research Projects . Compare the performance of different storage providers for different types and sizes of actor state. Comparison with other distributed application frameworks . Take a sample application written for another application framework, such as Google App Engine or Akka , and translate it into Orleans. Summarize the relative strengths and weaknesses of each framework by comparing the apps. Concluded Research projects: Below are a number of examples of previous successful research projects. Distributed log analysis, correlation and debugging . Debugging large-scale distributed systems is a challenging task due to enormous amounts of data and complex dynamic interactions between the distributed components, running on different processes and different machines. The goal of this project was to analyze prior art on this topic, propose a solution, and then implement prototype tools for collecting, correlating and analyzing application error log file data across a multi-machine distributed application runtime environment. This involved exploring the problem space from a variety of perspectives, including: a. Approaches to efficient logging, collection and analysis of failure information from various log-capture mechanisms in a distributed Orleans runtime environment. b. Possible applications of machine learning to find log patterns that signal serious production issues, and then detecting these patterns in near real time as a production monitoring utility. c. Ways to help individual developers perform real-time debugging of run-time issues with their applications. This project was performed successfully and result in a published paper PAD: Performance Anomaly Detection in Multi-Server Distributed Systems and a proof of concept implementation of a distributed log analysis tool. Horton - Distributed Graph Database . Horton was a research project with a goal to build a system to store, manage and query large-scale distributed graphs. It was implemented entirely as an Orleans application. The project resulted in a number of publications and a number of very successful student projects."

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Documentation Guidelines The Orleans documentation is built in Markdown . We use a few simple conventions to ensure a homogeneous style throughout the full set of documents. These standards are being introduced. If you have issues with these guidelines then raise an issue or a Pull Request. If you find documentation that fails to meet the guidelines, then make a fix and submit a pull request. Also if you are using windows 10 you can go to the store and find free MarkDown editors like this Structure Language The documentation will follow US-English spelling. Desktop tools like http://markdownpad.com have spell checking features. Paragraph structure Each sentence should be written on a single line, and only one sentence per line. This makes merging changes easier and also helps identify verbose language. Paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines. Headings Heading should be used to structure a document. Avoid using other emphasis features like ALLCAPS, Italics or bold to identify a new topic. Using a header is not only more consistent, but also allows linking to the header. Footers At the end of a page, it is helpful to link to the next logical page in the documentation. If the page is the last in a sub-section then linking back to the index page is useful. Styles Code formatting Blocks of example code should be formatted with the triple back tick format followed by the language ``` csharp [StorageProvider(ProviderName=\"store1\")] public class MyGrain<IMyGrainState> ... { ... } ``` Which will render as [StorageProvider(ProviderName=\"store1\")] public class MyGrain<IMyGrainState> ... { ... } Inline code should be marked with a single backtick (`). This include references to: type names e.g. Task<T> variable names e.g. game namespaces e.g. Orleans.Storage.AzureTableStorage If showing text that is an output (e.g. text file content or console output) you can either use the triple back tick without specifying a language or you can indent the content. For example: 1 said: Welcome to my team! 0 said: Thanks! 1 said: Thanks! 0 said: Thanks! File names and paths When referencing a filename, directory/folder or URI then use standard italics to format. This can be done by surrounding the string with either with a single asterisk ( * ) or a single underscore ( _ ) Examples: OrleansRuntimeInterfaces.dll C:\\Binaries ../src/Grain.cs Tables Markdown supports tabular data . Tables could be used to structure data so that is is easily consumable for the reader. Suffix Unit ms millisecond(s) s second(s) m minute(s) Links When referencing another concept, the concept should be linked to. Forward and backward references with in a page can be linked to via the header. e.g. link back to Structure Links to other documents can either link to the page, or a sub-section/header within the page. External links should be exposed as a the full link e.g. https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn Contribution The Orleans documentation is managed as Markdown files in a Git repository hosted on GitHub in the gh-pages branch . See the GitHub Pages documentation on how to use the gh-pages branch convention for \"Project site\" documents."

These are just a few ideas, so if you think of something else that would be useful, then spin up a discussion thread on GitHub to discuss the proposal, and go for it! Orleans GitHub Repository Pull requests are always welcome! Ideas for Contributions Intern and Student Projects Some suggestions for possible intern / student projects. Documentation Guidelines A style guide for writing documentation for this site. Code Contributions: This project uses the same contribution process as the other DotNet projects on GitHub. DotNet Project Contribution Guidelines Guidelines and workflow for contributing to DotNet projects on GitHub. DotNet CLA Contribution License Agreement for DotNet projects on GitHub. .NET Framework Design Guidelines Some basic API design rules, coding standards, and style guide for .NET Framework APIs. Coding Standards and Conventions We try not to be too OCD about coding style wars, but in case of disputes we do fall back to the core principles in the two \".NET Coding Standards\" books used by the other DotNet OSS projects on GitHub: C# Coding Style Guide .NET Framework Design Guidelines There are lots of other useful documents on the .NET CoreCLR and .NET Core Framework documentation sites which are worth reading, although most experienced C# developers will probably have picked up many of those best-practices by osmosis, particularly around performance and memory management. Source Code Organization Orleans has not religiously followed a \"One Class Per File\" rule, but instead we have tried to use pragmatic judgment to maximize the change of \"code understand-ability\" for developers on the team. If lots of small-ish classes share a \"common theme\" and/or are always dealt with together, then it is OK to place those into one source code file in most cases. See for example the various \"log consumer\" classes were originally placed in single source file, as they represented a single unit of code comprehension. As a corollary, it is much easier to find the source code for a class if it is in a file with the same name as the class [similar to Java file naming rules], so there is a tension and value judgment here between code find-ability and minimizing / constraining the number of projects in a solution and files within a project [which both have direct impact on the Visual Studio \"Opening\" and \"Building\" times for large projects]. Code search tools in VS and ReSharper definitely help here. Dependencies and Inter-Project References One topic that we are very strict about is around dependency references between components and sub-systems. Component / Project References References between projects in a solution must always use \" Project References \" rather than \" DLL References \" to ensure that component build relationships are known to the build tools. Right : <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\Orleans\\Orleans.csproj\"> <Project>{BC1BD60C-E7D8-4452-A21C-290AEC8E2E74}</Project> <Name>Orleans</Name> </ProjectReference> Wrong : <Reference Include=\"Orleans\" > <HintPath>..\\Orleans\\bin\\Debug\\Orleans.dll</HintPath> </Reference> In order to help ensure we keep inter-project references clean, then on the build servers [and local Build.cmd script] we deliberately use side-by-side input .\\src and output .\\Binaries directories rather than the more normal in-place build directory structure (eg. [PROJ]\\bin\\Release ) used by VS on local dev machines. Unified Component Versions We use the same unified versions of external component throughout the Orleans code base, and so should never need to add bindingRedirect entries in App.config files. Also, in general it should almost never be necessary to have Private=True elements in Orleans project files, except to override a conflict with a Windows / VS \"system\" component. Some package management tools can occasionally get confused when making version changes, and sometimes think that we are using multiple versions of the same assembly within a solution, which of course we never do. We long for the day when package management tools for .NET can make version changes transactionally! Until then, it is occasionally necessary to \"fix\" the misguided actions of some .NET package management tools by hand-editing the .csproj files (they are just XML text files) back to sanity and/or using the \"Discard Edited Line\" functions that most good Git tools such as Atlassian SourceTree provide. Using \"sort\" references and unified component versions avoids creating brittle links between Orleans run-time and/or external components, and has proved highly effective in the last several years at reducing stress levels for the Orleans Team during important deployment milestones. :)"

    "title": "Storage Providers | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Note : This sample requires the \"Official MongoDB C# Driver\" NuGet package from 10gen, Inc. If you want to run the sample and store data using MongoDB, you will also need to download and install MongoDB. Custom storage providers allow you to extend the capabilities of Orleans to store application data in new storage services. In this sample, we have code to store data in a file system (presumably networked) and in MongoDB. While binary formatting is almost always better to use for persistent storage, this sample chooses to use JSON as the external format for one reason: it's easier to read and verify, which is a good thing in a sample. As you adopt the sample code for more realistic use, you will probably want to switch to something else than JSON as the external format. Running the sample The sample solution consists of four projects -- the storage provider library, and three test libraries, with the same client+server structure that the Hello World sample has. Edit the DevTestServerConfiguration.xml file in the Test.Client project, uncommenting the element of the file-storage provider. <!-- To test the sample storage providers, uncomment one of the following two lines: <Provider Type=\"Samples.StorageProviders.MongoDBStorage\" Name=\"TestStore\" Database=\"orleanssamples\" ConnectionString=\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\" /> --> <Provider Type=\"Samples.StorageProviders.OrleansFileStorage\" Name=\"TestStore\" RootDirectory=\".\\Samples.FileStorage\"/> Build the solution. This will move everything where it needs to go, including the MongoDB client libraries that NuGet brought in. Set the 'Test.Client' project as the startup project and hit F5. Right before it stops spitting out text, it will have this to say: Successfully started Orleans silo 'host-001' as a Primary node. We just wrote something to the persistent store. Please verify! Orleans Silo is running. Press Enter to terminate... Stop the program and open a command line windows, move to the bin\\Debug folder of the Test.Client project. There should be a folder called Samples.FileStorage there. In that folder, you should find a single file: >>dir Directory: c:\\Orleans\\Samples\\StorageProviders\\Test.Client\\bin\\Debug\\Samples.FileStorage Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- -a--- 3/26/2014 19:50 48 0000...003ffffffc0950639.PersonState If you look at the contents of that file, you should see some JSON text: >> more .\\Samples.FileStorage\\0000000000000000000000000000000003ffffffc0950639.PersonState {\"FirstName\":\"John\",\"LastName\":\"Doe\",\"Gender\":0} Now, run the program again. It's written to detect that state already exists, so this time, it will have something else to say: Successfully started Orleans silo host-001' as a Primary node. This was found in the persistent store: John, Doe, Male Orleans Silo is running. Press Enter to terminate... If you have MongoDB installed , you can repeat this procedure to test the other storage provider. Just change which XML element in the configuration file that is uncommented and ensure that the mongod.exe process is running. When you inspect the data with the MongoDB shell (mongo.exe), it should look something like this: MongoDB shell version: 2.4.6 connecting to: test > use orleanssamples switched to db orleanssamples > db.PersonState.find() { \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"533391afcf20b011307a82bf\"), \"FirstName\" : \"John\", \"LastName\" : \"Doe\", \"Gender\" : 0, \"key\" : \"0000000000000000000000000000000003ffffffc0950639\" } > Design Since both concrete storage providers use JSON, we place the serialization and deserialization code in a base class, BaseJSONStorageProvider . It contains the logic for Init() , ReadStateAsync() , WriteStateAsync() and ClearStateAsync() , the main interface methods of IStorageProvider. The logic to deal with the underlying store is delegated to a DataManager class hiearchy: IJSONStateDataManager , GrainFileStateManager , and GrainStateMongoDataManager . Their methods Delete() , Read() and Write() correspond directly to the methods defined in the storage provider classes. In this description, we won't go into the details of interacting with the file system or MongoDB via .NET, that is described in detail elsewhere. A couple of things in the code requires explanation, though. In both cases, the name of the grain type is used as name for the collection of instances; in the file storage provider case, the collection name is mapped to the folder that data is stored in, while the primary key is used to identify the actual instance; in the MongoDB case, the type name denotes a database collection, while the primary key is used as the document name. In the MongoDB case, the JSON structure is augmented during a write operation with another element, key, which contains the Orleans grain key and allows us to query for that document when reading. Care is also taken to maintain the Mongo-internal _id document identity. public Task Write(string collectionName, string key, string entityData) { var collection = GetOrCreateCollection(collectionName); var query = Query.EQ(\"key\", key); var existing = collection.FindOne(query); var doc = MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.BsonSerializer.Deserialize<BsonDocument>(entityData); doc[\"key\"] = key; if ( existing == null ) { collection.Insert(doc); } else { doc[\"_id\"] = existing[\"_id\"]; collection.Update(query, Update.Replace(doc)); } return TaskDone.Done; } On read, the _id field is removed from the JSON document that is passed back to the caller, since that is not part of the Orleans data model. public Task<string> Read(string collectionName, string key) { var collection = GetCollection(collectionName); if (collection == null) return Task.FromResult<string>(null); var query = Query.EQ(\"key\", key); var existing = collection.FindOne(query); if (existing == null) return Task.FromResult<string>(null); existing.Remove(\"_id\"); existing.Remove(\"key\"); var strwrtr = new System.IO.StringWriter(); var writer = new MongoDB.Bson.IO.JsonWriter(strwrtr, new MongoDB.Bson.IO.JsonWriterSettings()); MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.BsonSerializer.Serialize<BsonDocument>(writer, existing); return Task.FromResult(strwrtr.ToString()); }"

    "title": "Presence Service | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc A presence service serves as the hub of many social applications, including multi-player games and chats. Its essential function is to know who is online at at given point in time and alert other users of their online presence. Each logged-in player sends a \"heartbeat pulse\" at regular intervals, In this section we walk through the steps involved in defining and using a new Player grain type. The grain type we define will have one property that returns a reference to the game the player is currently in, and two methods for joining and leaving a game. We will create three separate pieces of code: the grain interface definition, the grain implementation, and a standard C# class that uses the grain. Each of these belongs in a different project, built into a different DLL: the interface needs to be available on both the \"client\" and \"server\" sides, while the implementation class should be hidden from the client, and the client class from the server. The interface project should be created using the Visual Studio \"Orleans Grain Interface Collection\" template that is included in the Orleans SDK, and the grain implementation project should be created using the Visual Studio \"Orleans Grain Class Collection\" template. The grain client project can use any standard .NET code project template, such as the standard Console Application or Class Library templates. A grain cannot be explicitly created or deleted. It always exists \"virtually\" and is activated automatically when a request is sent to it. A grain has either a GUID, string or a long integer key within the grain type. Application code creates a reference to a grain by calling the GetGrain<TGrainType>(Guid id) or GetGrain<TGrainType>(long id) or other overloads of a generic grain factory methods for a specific grain identity. The GetGrain() call is a purely local operation to create a grain reference. It does not trigger creation of a grain activation and has not impact on its life cycle. A grain activation is automatically created by the Orleans runtime upon a first request sent to the grain. A grain interface must inherit from one of the IGrainWithXKey .interfaces where X is the type of the key used. The GUID, string or long integer key of a grain can later be retrieved via the GetPrimaryKey() or GetPrimaryKeyLong() extension methods, respectively. Defining the Grain Interface A grain type is defined by an interface that inherits from one of the IGrainWithXKey marker interfaces like 'IGrainWithGuidKey' or 'IGrainWithStringKey'. All of the methods in the grain interface must return a Task or a Task<T> . The underlying type T for value Task must be serializable. Example: public interface IPlayerGrain : IGrainWithGuidKey { Task<IGameGrain> GetCurrentGame(); Task JoinGame(IGameGrain game); Task LeaveGame(IGameGrain game); } Using the Grain Factory After the grain interface has been defined, building the project originally created with the Orleans Visual Studio project template will use the Orleans-specific MSBuild targets to generate a client proxy classes corresponding to the user-defined grain interfaces and to merge this additional code back into the interface DLL. Application should use the generic grain factory class to get references to grains. Inside the grain code, the factory is available via the protected GrainFactory class member property. On the client side the factory is available via the GrainClient.GrainFactory static field. When running inside a grain the following code should be used to get the grain reference: this.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IPlayerGrain>(grainKey); When running on the Orleans client side the following code should be used to get the grain reference: GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IPlayerGrain>(grainKey); The Implementation Class A grain type is materialized by a class that implements the grain type’s interface and inherits directly or indirectly from Orleans.Grain . The PlayerGrain grain class implements the IPlayerGrain interface. public class PlayerGrain : Grain, IPlayerGrain { private IGameGrain currentGame; // Game the player is currently in. May be null. public Task<IGameGrain> GetCurrentGameAsync() { return Task.FromResult(currentGame); } // Game grain calls this method to notify that the player has joined the game. public Task JoinGameAsync(IGameGrain game) { currentGame = game; Console.WriteLine(\"Player {0} joined game {1}\", this.GetPrimaryKey(), game.GetPrimaryKey()); return TaskDone.Done; } // Game grain calls this method to notify that the player has left the game. public Task LeaveGameAsync(IGameGrain game) { currentGame = null; Console.WriteLine(\"Player {0} left game {1}\", this.GetPrimaryKey(), game.GetPrimaryKey()); return TaskDone.Done; } }"

It demonstrates that while there is no such thing as \"trivial\" when you are dealing with distributed computing, Orleans makes it pretty straight-forward. Azure Web Sample An Azure-hosted version of Hello World. Adventure Before there was graphical user interfaces, before the era of game consoles and massive-multiplayer games, there were VT100 terminals and there was Colossal Cave Adventure . Possibly lame by today's standards, back then it was a magical world of monsters, chirping birds, and things you could pick up. It's the inspiration for this sample. Presence Service This sample shows the principles behind a typical (though much simplified) presence service, such as you would find in online games and other social applications. Tic Tac Toe This is a simple online version of the classic board game. Chirper A simple social network pub/sub system, with chirp messages being sent from publishers to followers. Twitter Sentiment This sample uses Orleans to aggregate and analyze twitter data for a simple sentiment dashboard. Twitter Sentiment relies on a Node.js project for some of its functionality, as well as Twitter developer credentials. To use this sample, you will need to: Get the Node.js Tools for Visual Studio Get a Twitter account Sign up as a Twitter Developer. GPS Tracker A combination of Orleans and SignalR is used to simulate GPS devices tracked as they move around San Francisco, updating their locations as they change.

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc In this sample, a client connects with an Orleans grain instance, sends it a greeting and receives a greeting back. The client then prints that greeting and that's that. Simple enough in theory, but since there's distribution involved, there's a bit more to it. There are three projects involved -- one for declaring the communication interfaces, one for the grain implementations, and one for the client, which also hosts the Orleans silo that loads the grain when activated. There's only one communication interface, in IHello.cs: public interface IHello : Orleans.IGrain { Task<string> SayHello(string greeting); } This is simple enough, and we can see that all replies must be represented as a Task or Task in communication interfaces. The implementation, found in HelloGrain.cs, is similarly trivial: public class HelloGrain : Orleans.Grain, HelloWorldInterfaces.IHello { Task<string> HelloWorldInterfaces.IHello.SayHello(string greeting) { return Task.FromResult(\"You said: '\" + greeting + \"', I say: Hello!\"); } } The class inherits from an Orleans-defined base class, and implements the communication interface defined earlier. Since there is nothing that the grain needs to wait on, the method is not declared async and instead returns its value using Task.FromResult() . The client, which orchestrates the grain code and is found in Program.cs, looks like this: Orleans.GrainClient.Initialize(\"DevTestClientConfiguration.xml\"); var friend = HelloWorldInterfaces.HelloFactory.GetGrain(0); Console.WriteLine(\"\\n\\n{0}\\n\\n\", friend.SayHello(\"Good morning!\").Result); There's other code in the method, too, but that is unrelated to the client logic, it's hosting the Orleans silo."

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc A sample application to show how Orleans could be used in conjunction with SignalR to monitor the position of a number of GPS enabled devices, and report these to a web browser. In order to run this sample, you need a Bing Maps API key. The key is used by the GPSTracker.Web project, in Views\\Home\\Index.cshtml. Get a Bing Maps Key Running the Sample Running the sample locally: Open the GPSTracker.sln file in Visual Studio 2013, and build the solution. Start the local Orleans Silo by running the Host project of the solution. In Visual Studio, right click on the GPSTracker.Web project, and click Set as StartUp Project . Press F5 to start GPSTracker.Web web application. Your browser should open on a map of San Francisco. In a command window, navigate to the GPSTracker.FakeDeviceGateway\\bin\\Debug directory, and run the 'GPSTracker.FakeDeviceGateway.exe' program. Pushpins should appear on the map, and move around. Blue ones are moving slow, orange faster. How it Works The GPSTracker.FakeDeviceGateway.exe program simulates data generated from 20 GPS devices. It randomly alters their speed and heading to simulate the devices moving within rectangular boundaries. It sends the position data to Orleans once a second. In Orleans, each device is represented by a Device grain. The grain records the previous position of the device, and can therefore calculate the speed of the device. If the devices has moved, the 'Device' grain forwards position and speed to a PushNotification grain. This 'PushNotification' grain maintains a C# SignalR client, which connects to a SignalR hub hosted in the GPSTracker.Web project. This allows the grain to 'push' messages to the hub without the need for polling the Orleans API. The grain will batch messages together to improve network performance. The GPSTracker.Web application forwards all messages to connected web browsers using SignalR. JavaScript running in the browser positions the pins using a Bing Maps control. If the pin has a low velocity it colors it blue, otherwise orange. Advantages of using Orleans This sample is designed to show Orleans as a low-latency messaging system. Orleans is able to hold state for each device in memory (of which there may be many), allowing a quick calculation to be performed (calculating velocity) based on previous state. The grain in Orleans can also decide whether the message is worthy of forwarding downstream (has the device moved?) and can therefore filter out unnecessary messages and reduce noise. The sample also illustrates how SignalR may be used from inside a grain to allow 'push' messaging directly to clients. In a real life scenario you would probably not forward all messages to the browser, and would filter based on groups or device type."

The loader script, #2 Start the Chirper client #3 Start a second Chirper client as a publisher #4 Type a comment into the publisher client window, and see it displayed on the other client console window. Overview The NetworkLoader program reads a graphml data file containing a description of a network of Users and Followers. The NetworkLoader program sets up a network of ChirperAccount (aka \"users\") grains based on the input data file, one grain for each user defined in the network. It then creates the follower links between those users by calling the FollowUserId method on the appropriate user grain. For this demo, we use a simplified network of 1,000 Users with a total of 27,000 Follower links connecting those Users, but other network data files can be created with the NetworkGenerator program, or with a normal text / XML editor. The ChirperClient program connects to the Chirper network as a user specified on the cmd line. It then listens for any new Chirps that might be sent out by the other users they follow. When you type a comment into the publisher window, the text is sent as a Chirp message to all followers of that user, including the first client console window, as well as being echo'ed on the publisher's window. Why Orleans? Orleans allows the network of Chirper users to be described via very simple C# code whilst allowing it to easily scale out to handle increasing number of users and volume of chirp messages. How is it modeled? Chirper users are modeled as grains, which provides a very natural mapping of concepts. These grains allow to distribute the load for handling the message throughput, with each grain handling the forwarding of messages generated by that user to any other users that are following them. The grains implement three different grain interfaces to represent the three functional facets of those entities -- IChirperPublisher , IChirperSubscriber and IChirperAccount There is also an IChirperViewer observer interface for applications to subscribe for status changes from a particular Chirper user without becoming a Follower. This observer interface is typically used when writing client UI applications such as ChirperClient . Things for you to do if you are so inclined: Connect more clients to see the Chirper broadcast behavior. Make the network of users much bigger. Make the rate of generating messages higher."

Orleans allows the game to be described via very simple C# code while allowing it to scale to a massive multiplayer game. For this motivation to be meaningful, the labyrinth of rooms needs to be very large and need to support a large number of simultaneous players. One value of Orleans is that the service can be designed for growth, the overhead of running it at a small scale is not significant, and you can remain confident that it will scale if the need arises. How is it modeled? Player and Rooms are modeled as grains. These grains allow us to distribute the game with each grain modelling state and functionality. Things such as keys are modeled as plain old objects - they are really just simple immutable data structures that move around rooms and among players; they don't need to be grains.

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Orleans maintains a number of internal tables for different runtime mechanisms. Here we list all the tables and provide more details on their internal structure. Runtime tables: Orleans Silo Instances table Reminders table Silo Metrics table Clients Metrics table Silo Statistics table Clients Statistics table Orleans Silo Instances table Orleans Silo Instances table, also commonly referred to as Membership table, lists the set of silos that make an Orleans deployment. More details can be found in the description of the Cluster Management Protocol that maintains this table. All rows in this table consist of the following columns ( SiloInstanceTableEntry ): PartitionKey - deployment id. RowKey - Silo IP Address + \"-\" + Silo Port + \"-\" + Silo Generation number (epoch) DeploymentId - the deployment id of this Orleans service Address - IP address Port - silo to silo TCP port Generation - Generation number (epoch number) HostName - silo Hostname Status - status of this silo, as set by cluster management protocol. Any of the type Orleans.Runtime.SiloStatus ProxyPort - silo to clients TCP port Primary - whether this silo is primary or not. Deprecated. RoleName - If running is Azure - the name of this role. If running on premises, the name of the executing assembly. InstanceName - If running is Azure - the name of this role instance. If running on premises, the silo name that the silo host gave it. UpdateZone - Azure update zone, if running is Azure. FaultZone - Azure fault zone, if running is Azure. SuspectingSilos - the list of silos that suspect this silo. Managed by cluster management protocol. SuspectingTimes - the list of times when this silo was suspected. Managed by cluster management protocol. StartTime - the time when this silo was started. IAmAliveTime - the last time this silo reoprted that it is alive. Used for diagnostics and troubleshooting only. There is also a special row in this table, called membership version row, with the following columns: PartitionKey - deployment id. RowKey - \"VersionRow\" costant string DeploymentId MembershipVersion - the latest version of the current membership configuration. Naming: The silo instance row has 3 names: hostname, rolename and instance name. What is the difference? First, it is important to note that Orleans cluster protocol does not use any of these names for distinguishing between silos. Instead it uses IP:port:epoch as a unique identity of a silo instance. Therefore, setting of those 3 names has no impact on runtime correctness. It is in the table merely to help diagnostics and operational troubleshooting. Hostname is always set to the name of this host, as returned by Dns.GetHostName() . Role name is a logical name of the whole service and instance name is the name of this specific silo instance within this service. Role name and Instance name depend on the hosting - where the silo runs. Each silo host can set those differently. Azure host ( AzureSiloHost ) sets the role name to Azure role name ( myRoleInstance.Role.Name ) and instance name to Azure role Instance name ( myRoleInstance.Id ). On premises ( SiloHost ) the role name is the executing assembly name ( Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Name ) and the instance name is the name the host gave to that silo when it was started. Orleans Reminders table Orleans Reminders table durably stores all the reminders registered in the system. Each reminder has a separate row. All rows in this table consist of the following columns ( ReminderTableEntry ): PartitionKey - ServiceId + \"_\" + GrainRefConsistentHash RowKey - GrainReference + \"-\" ReminderName GrainReference - the grain reference of the grain that created this reminder. ReminderName - the name of this reminder ServiceId - the service id of the currently running Orleans service DeploymentId - the deployment id of the currently running Orleans service StartAt - the time when this reminder was supposed to tick in the first time Period - the time period for this reminder GrainRefConsistentHash - the consistent hash of the GrainReference Silo Metrics table Silo metrics table containes a small set of per-silo important key performance metrics (usually known as KPI - Key Performance Indicators ). Each silo has one row, periodically updated in-place by its silo ( SiloMetricsData ). PartitionKey - DeploymentId RowKey - silo name DeploymentId - the deployment id of this Orleans service Address - the silo address (ip:port:epoch) of this silo SiloName - the name of this silo (in Azure it is its Instance name) GatewayAddress - the gateway ip:port of tis silo HostName - the hostname of this silo CPU - current CPU utilization MemoryUsage - current memory usage ( GC.GetTotalMemory(false) ) Activations - number of activations on this silo RecentlyUsedActivations - number of activations on this silo that were used in the last 10 minutes (Note: this number may currently not be accurate if different age limits are used for different grain types). SendQueue - the current size of the send queue (number of messages waiting to be send). Only captures remote messages to other silos (not including messages to the clients). ReceiveQueue - the current size of the receive queue (number of messages that arrived to this silo and are waiting to be dispatched). Captures both remote and local messages from other silos as well as from the clients. RequestQueue SentMessages - total number of remote messages sent to other silos as well as to the clients. ReceivedMessages - total number of remote received messages, from other silos as well as from the clients. LoadShedding - whether this silo is currently overloaded and is in the load shedding mode. Clients - number of currently connected clients Clients Metrics table Silo metrics table containes a small set of per-Orleans-client important key performance metrics. Each client has one row, periodically updated in-place by its client. Client metrics are essentilay a subset of silo metrics ( ClientMetricsData ). PartitionKey - DeploymentId RowKey - Address DeploymentId - the deployment id of this Orleans service Address - the address (ip:port) of this client ClientId - the unique name of this client (pseudo client grain id) HostName - the hostname of this client CPU - current CPU utilization MemoryUsage - current memory usage ( GC.GetTotalMemory(false) ) SendQueue - the current size of the send queue (number of messages waiting to be send). Captures remote messages to other silos. ReceiveQueue - the current size of the receive queue (number of messages that arrived to this client and are waiting to be dispatched, including responses). SentMessages - total number of remote messages sent to silos. ReceivedMessages - total number of remote received messages from silos. ConnectedGatewayCount - number of gateways that this client is currently connected to. Silo Statistics table Silo Statistics table containes a large set of per-silo detailed statistic counters. Most of them are low level performance statistics, which are usualy used in troubleshooting scenarios. A set of examples and methodology of how those statistics can be used are described in our paper PAD: Performance Anomaly Detection in Multi-Server Distributed Systems and a proof of concept . Each statistic value is one row. This table is append only. Every silo periodicaly (usually every 5 minutes, configurable) appends all its latest statistic counter values. The number of counters per silo is currently about 200. So every 5 minutes every silo appends around 200 rows to this table. Each row is in the format ( StatsTableData ): PartitionKey - DeploymentId$ReverseTimestampToTheNearestHour - deploymentId and last hour RowKey - ReverseTimestampToTheNearestSecond$Name$counter - current second, silo name, monotonically growing sequence number DeploymentId - the deployment id of this Orleans service Time - the current time of the reporting on the reporting silo Address - the silo address (ip:port:epoch) of this silo Name - the name of this silo (in Azure it is its Instance name) HostName - the host name of this silo Statistic - the name of the statistic counter StatValue - the value of the statistic counter IsDelta - if this the statistic counter value is delta since last value reported or an absolute value The rationale behind the choice of partition key and row key is described here and here .

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Relational storage backend code in Orleans is built on generic ADO.NET functionality and is consequently database vendor agnostic. The Orleans data storage layout has been explained already in Runtime Tables . Setting up the connection strings are done as explained in Orleans Configuration Guide and SQL Tables . To make Orleans code function with a given relational database backend, two things are needed: Appropriate ADO.NET libraries need to be loaded to the process. This should be defined as usual, e.g. via DbProviderFactories element in application configuration. Orleans should know about which libraries to use (multiple can exist in GAC or otherwise). The ADO.NET invariant is provided via AdoInvariant attribute in the element defining the connection string, by default it is System.Data.SqlClient The database needs to exist so that it is compatible with the code. This is most conveniently done by creating a vendor specific database creation script. Currently there is database script defined for SQL Server for versions 2000 and newer ( CreateOrleansTables_SqlServer.sql ). If you need other ones, open an issue or please, stop by at Orleans Gitter . Orleans uses a fixed set of queries defined in a well-known table OrleansQuery . These are the only queries used by Orleans. The queries are loaded when silo starts using the given connection string. All the queries are also parameterized, i.e. Orleans does not use techniques such as string formatting to run queries. From the perspective of Orleans database code, the code will technically work with any given database structure as long as the following are defined (this is the interface contract between Orleans and relational storage): The names of the queries defined in OrleansQuery are defined as Orleans expects them. The keys are hardcoded in Orleans database code. The column names and types are what Orleans expects when Orleans issues a SELECT query. The parameter names and types are what Orleans expects when Orleans issues other than SELECT query. Specifically from the aforementioned three rules it follows that table names and layout, indexing and so forth can be defined and tuned without code changes as long as the used names and types are retained. The interface contract is written in more detail in CreateOrleansTables_SqlServer.sql , which contains a throughout description of the table structure and how it related to the Runtime Tables , Cluster Management and the concrete membership protocol implementation . Also, the SQL Server implementation contains SQL Server edition specific tuning. Currently all but one query are single row inserts or updates (note, one could replace UPDATE queries with INSERT ones provided the associated SELECT queries would provide the last write) except for statistic inserts. Statistic insert, as defined by InsertOrleansStatisticsKey writes the statistics in batches of predefined maximum size ( currently 200 rows ) using UNION ALL for all databases except for Oracle, for which a UNION ALL FROM DUAL construct is used. InsertOrleansStatisticsKey is the only query that defines a kind of a template parameters of which Orleans multiplies as many times as there are parameters with differing values. Known issues Currently there is a database script only for SQL Server. Closely related to this is that the current implementation is only tested with SQL Server. To add a new backend and test it with the current set, the following needs to be done: Add a new script to create the database. Add the vendor invariant name (e.g. System.Data.SqlClient ) to AdoNetInvariants . This is used to select the correct statistics insert mode (i.e. the UNION ALL with or without FROM DUAL ) and in automatic testing. Add some other ADO.NET provider specific data to QueryConstantsBag . These are (potentially) used in some query operations. Patch the test runner so it accepts the invariant name as a parameter, see at SqlTestsEnvironment and LivenessTests_SqlServer . The relational setup testing code is a good candinate for refactoring. For instance one could detect if a database is installed in listening to connections when it has a script defined and if so, run the storage tests on it. Currently there is no automatic storage tests to detect correct metrics or statistics operations"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Orleans messaging delivery guarantees are at-most-once , by default. Optionally, if configured to do retries upon timeout, Orleans provides at-least-once deliv­ery instead. In more details: Every message in Orleans has automatic timeout (the exact timeout can be configured). If the reply does not arrive on time the return Task is broken with timeout exception. Orleans can be configured to do automatic retries upon timeout. By default we do NOT do automatic retries. Application code of course can also pick to do retries upon timeout. If the Orleans system is configured not to do automatic retries (default setting) and application is not resending – Orleans provides at most once message delivery . A message will either be delivered once or not at all. It will never be delivered twice. In the system with retries (either by the runtime or by the application) the message may arrive multiple times. Orleans currently does nothing to durably store which messages already arrived and suppress the second delivery (we believe this would be pretty costly). So in the system with retries Orleans does NOT guarantee at most once delivery. If you keep retrying potentially indefinitely , the message will eventually arrive , thus providing at least once delivery guarantee. Notice that “will eventually arrive” is something that the runtime needs to guarantee. It does not come for free just by itself even if you keep retrying. Orleans provides eventually delivery since grains never go into any permanent failure state and a failed grain will for sure eventually be re-activated on another silo. So to summarize : in the system without retries Orleans guarantees at most once message delivery. In the system with infinite retries Orleans guarantee at least once (and does NOT guarantee at most once). Note : In the Orleans technical report we accidentally only mentioned the 2nd option with automatic retries and forgot to mention that by default with no retries, Orleans provides at most once delivery."

    "title": "Load balancing in Orleans | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Load balancing, in a broad sense, is one of the pillars of the Orleans runtime . Orleans runtime tries to make everything balanced, since balancing allows to maximize resource usage and avoid hotspots, which leads to better performance, as well as helps with elasticity. Load balancing in Orleans applies in multiple places. Below is a non-exhaustive list of places where the runtime performs balancing: Default actor placement strategy is random - new activations are placed randomly across silos. That results in a balanced placement and prevents hotspots for most scenarios. A more advanced ActivationCountPlacement tries to equalize the number of activations on all silos, which results in a more even distribution of activations across silos. This is especially important for elasticity. Grain Directory service is built on top of a Distributed Hash Table, which inherently is balanced. The directory service maps grains to activations, each silo owns part of the global mapping table, and this table is globally partitioned in a balanced way across all silos. We use consistent hashing with virtual buckets for that. Clients connect to all gateways and spread their requests across them, in a balanced way. Reminder service is a distributed partitioned runtime service. The assignment of which silo is responsible to serve which reminder is balanced across all silos via consistent hashing, just like in grain directory. Performance critical components within a silo are partitioned, and the work across them is locally balanced . That way the silo runtime can fully utilize all available CPU cores and not create in-silo bottlenecks. This applies to all local resources: allocation of work to threads, sockets, dispatch responsibilities, queues, etc. StreamQueueBalance balances the responsibility of pulling events from persistence queues across silos in the cluster. Also notice that balancing, in a broad sense, does not necessarily mean loss of locality . One can be balanced and still maintain a good locality. For example, when balancing means sharding/partitioning, you can partition responsibility for a certain logical task, while still maintaining locality within each partition. That applies both for local and distributed balancing. Refer to this presentation on Balancing Techniques in Orleans for more details."

    "title": "Using Consul as a Membership Provider | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Introduction to Consul Consul is a distributed, highly available and datacenter-aware service discovery platform which includes simple service registration, health checking, failure detection and key/value storage. It is built on the premise that every node in the datacenter is running a Consul agent which is either acting as a server or client which communicate via a scalable gossip protocol. There is a very detailed overview of Consul including comparisons with similar solutions here . Consul is written in GO and is open source ; compiled downloads are available for Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris and Windows Why Choose Consul? As an Orleans Membership Provider , Consul is a good choice when you need to deliver an on-premise solution which does not require your potential customers to have existing infrastructure and a co-operative IT provider. Consul is a very lightweight single executable, has no dependencies and as such can easily be built into your own middleware solution. And when Consul is already your solution for discovering, checking and maintaining your microservices, it makes sense to fully integrate with Orleans membership for simplicity and ease of operation. We therefore implemented a membership table in Consul (also known as \"Orleans Custom System Store\"), which fully integrates with Orleans's Cluster Management . Setting up Consul There is very extensive documentation available on Consul.io about setting up a stable Consul cluster and it doesn't make sense to repeat that here; however for your convenience we include this guide so you can very quickly get Orleans running with a standalone Consul agent. 1) Create a folder to install Consul into, e.g. C:\\Consul 2) Create a subfolder: C:\\Consul\\Data (Consul will not create this if it doesn't exist) 3) Download and unzip Consul.exe into C:\\Consul\\ 4) Open a command prompt at C:\\Consul\\ 5) Enter Consul.exe agent -server -bootstrap -data-dir \"C:\\Consul\\Data\" -client=0.0.0.0 agent Instructs Consul to run the agent process that hosts the services. Without this the Consul process will attempt to use RPC to configure a running agent. -server Defines the agent as a server and not a client (A Consul client is an agent that hosts all the services and data, but does not have voting rights to decide, and cannot become, the cluster leader -bootstrap The first (and only the first!) node in a cluster must be bootstrapped so that it assumes the cluster leadership. -data-dir [path] Specifies the path where all Consul data is stored, including the cluster membership table -client=0.0.0.0 Informs Consul which IP to open the service on. There are many other parameters, and the option to use a json configuration file. Please consult the Consul documentation for a full listing of the options. 6) Verify that Consul is running and ready to accept membership requests from Orleans by opening the services endpoint in your browser. Configuration of Orleans Server There is currently a known issue with the \"Custom\" membership provider OrleansConfiguration.xml configuration file that will fail to parse correctly. For this reason you have to provide a placeholder SystemStore in the xml and then configure the provider in code before starting the Silo. OrleansConfiguration.xml <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"None\" DataConnectionString=\"http://localhost:8500\" DeploymentId=\"MyOrleansDeployment\" /> </Globals> </OrleansConfiguration> Code public void Start(ClusterConfiguration config) { _siloHost = new SiloHost(System.Net.Dns.GetHostName(), config); _siloHost.Config.Globals.LivenessType = GlobalConfiguration.LivenessProviderType.Custom; _siloHost.Config.Globals.MembershipTableAssembly = \"OrleansConsulUtils\"; _siloHost.Config.Globals.ReminderServiceType = GlobalConfiguration.ReminderServiceProviderType.Disabled; _siloHost.InitializeOrleansSilo(); var startedok = _siloHost.StartOrleansSilo(); if (!startedok) throw new SystemException(String.Format(\"Failed to start Orleans silo '{0}' as a {1} node\", _siloHost.Name, _siloHost.Type)); Log.Information(\"Orleans Silo is running.\\n\"); } Alternatively you could configure the silo entirely in code. Client The client configuration is much simpler ClientConfiguration.xml <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"Custom\" CustomGatewayProviderAssemblyName=\"OrleansConsulUtils\" DataConnectionString=\"http://192.168.1.26:8500\" DeploymentId=\"MyOrleansDeployment\" /> </ClientConfiguration> Client SDK If you are interested in using Consul for your own service discovery there are Client SDKs for most popular languages. Implementation Detail The Membership Table Provider makes use of Consul's Key/Value store functionality with CAS. When each Silo starts it registers two KV entries, one which contains the Silo details and one which holds the last time the Silo reported it was alive (the latter refers to diagnostics \"I am alive\" entries and not to failure detection hearbeats which are sent directly between the silos and are not written into the table). All writes to the table are performed with CAS to provide concurrency control, as necessitated by Orleans's Cluster Management Protocol . Once the Silo is running you can view these entries in your web browser here , this will display something like: [ \"orleans/MyOrleansDeployment/192.168.1.26:11111@191780753\", \"orleans/MyOrleansDeployment/192.168.1.26:11111@191780753/iamalive\" ] You will notice that the keys are prefixed with \"orleans/\" this is hard coded in the provider and is intended to avoid key space collision with other users of Consul. Each of these keys can be read by appending their key name (sans quotes of course) to the Consul KV root . Doing so will present you with the following: [ { \"LockIndex\": 0, \"Key\": \"orleans/MyOrleansDeployment/192.168.1.26:11111@191780753\", \"Flags\": 0, \"Value\": \"[BASE64 UTF8 Encoded String]\", \"CreateIndex\": 10, \"ModifyIndex\": 12 } ] Decoding the string will give you the actual Orleans Membership data: http://localhost:8500/v1/KV/orleans/MyOrleansDeployment/[SiloAddress] { \"Hostname\": \"[YOUR_MACHINE_NAME]\", \"ProxyPort\": 22222, \"StartTime\": \"2016-01-29T16:25:54.9538838Z\", \"Status\": 3, \"SuspectingSilos\": [] } http://localhost:8500/v1/KV/orleans/MyOrleansDeployment/[SiloAddress]/IAmAlive \"2016-01-29T16:35:58.9193803Z\" When the Clients connect, they read the KVs for all silos in the cluster in one HTTP GET by using the uri http://192.168.1.26:8500/v1/KV/orleans/MyOrleansDeployment/?recurse . Limitations Orleans Extended Membership Protocol (Table Version & ETag) Consul KV currrently does not currently support atomic updates. Therefore, the Orleans Consul Membership Provider only implements the the Orleans Basic Membership Protocol, as described here and does not support the Extended Membership Protocol. This Extended protocol was introduced as an additional, but not essential, silo connectivity validation and as a foundation to functionality that has not yet been implemented. Providing your infrastructure is correctly configured you will not experience any detrimental effect of the lack of support. Multiple Datacenters The Key Value Pairs in Consul are not currently replicated between Consul datacenters. There is a separate project to address this but it has not yet been proven to support Orleans. When running on Windows When Consul starts on Windows it logs the following message: ==> WARNING: Windows is not recommended as a Consul server. Do not use in production. This is displayed simply due to lack of focus on testing when running in a Windows environment and not because of any actual known issues. Read the discussion here before deciding if Consul is the right choice for you. Potential Future Enhanecements 1) Prove that the Consul KV replication project is able to support an Orleans cluster in a WAN environment between multiple Consul datacenters. 2) Implement the Reminder Table in Consul. 3) Implement the Extended Membership Protocol. The team behind Consul does plan on implementing atomic operations, once this functionality is available it will be possible to remove the limitations in the provider."

The goal of this protocol is for all silos (Orleans servers) to agree on the set of currently alive silos, detect failed silos, and allow new silos to join the cluster. The protocol relies on an external service to provide an abstraction of MembershipTable . MembershipTable is a flat No-SQL like durable table that we use for 2 purposes. First, it is used as a rendezvous point for silos to find each other and Orleans clients to find silos. Second, it is used to store the current membership view (list of alive silos) and helps coordinate the agreement on the membership view. We currently have 5 implementations of the MembershipTable : based on Azure Table Storage , SQL server, Apache ZooKeeper , Consul IO and in-memory emulation for development. In addition to the MembershipTable each silo participates in fully distributed peer-to-peer membership protocol that detects failed silos and reaches agreement on a set alive silos. We start by describing the internal implementation of the Orleans's membership protocol below and later on describe the implementation of the MembershipTable . The Basic Membership Protocol: Upon startup every silo writes itself into a well-known MembershipTable (passed via config). A combination of silo identity ( ip:port:epoch ) and service deployment id are used as unique keys in the table. Epoch is just time in ticks when this silo started, and as such ip:port:epoch is guaranteed to be unique in a given Orleans deployment. Silos monitor each other directly, via application pings (\"are you alive\" heartbeats ). Pings are sent as direct messages from silo to silo, over the same TCP sockets that silos communicate. That way, pings fully correlate with actual networking problems and server health. Every silo pings X other silos. A silo picks whom to ping by calculating consistent hashes on other silos' identity, forming a virtual ring of all identities and picking X successor silos on the ring (this is a well-known distributed technique called consistent hashing and is widely used in many distributed hash tables, like Chord DHT ). If a silo S does not get Y ping replies from a monitored servers P, it suspects it by writing its timestamped suspicion into P’s row in the MembershipTable . If P has more than Z suspicions within K seconds, then S writes that P is dead into P’s row, and broadcasts a request for all silos to re-read the membership table (which they’ll do anyway periodically). In more details: 5.1 Suspicion is written to the MembershipTable , in a special column in the row corresponding to P. When S suspects P it writes: “at time TTT S suspected P”. 5.2 One suspicion is not enough to declare P as dead. You need Z suspicions from different silos in a configurable time window T, typically 3 minutes, to declare P as dead. The suspicion is written using optimistic concurrency control provided by the MembershipTable . 5.3 The suspecting silo S reads P's row. 5.4 If S is the last suspector (there have already been Z-1 suspectors within time period T, as written in the suspicion column), S decides to declare P as Dead. In this case, S adds itself to list of suspectors and also writes in P's Status column that P is Dead. 5.5 Otherwise, if S is not the last suspector, S just adds itself to the suspectors column. 5.6 In either case the write back uses the version number or etag that was read, so the updates to this row are serialized. In case the write has failed due to version/etag mismatch, S retries (read again, and try to write, unless P was already marked dead). 5.7 At a high level this sequence of \"read, local modify, write back\" is a transaction. However, we are not using storage transactions to do that. “Transaction” code executes locally on a server and we use optimistic concurrency provided by the `MembershipTable` to ensure isolation and atomicity. Every silo periodically reads the entire membership table for its deployment. That way silos learn about new silos joining and about other silos being declared dead. Configuration : we provide a default configuration, which was hand tuned during our production usage in Azure. Currently the default is: every silo is monitored by 3 other silos, 2 suspicions are enough to declare a silo dead, suspicions only from last 3 minutes (otherwise they are outdated). Pings are send every 10 seconds and you needs to miss 3 pings to suspect a silo. Enforcing Perfect Failure detection – it is theoretically possible that a silo will be declared dead if it lost communication with other silos, while the silo process itself is still running. To solve this problem once the silo is declared dead in the table it is considered dead by everyone, even if it is in fact not dead (just partitioned temporarily or heartbeat messages got lost). Everyone stops communicating with it and once it learns that it is dead (by reading its own new status from the table) it commits suicide and shuts down its process. As a result, there must be an infrastructure in place to restart the silo as a new process (a new epoch number is generated upon start). When it's hosted in Azure, that happens automatically. When it isn't, another infrastructure is required. For example, a Windows Service configured to auto restart on failure. Optimization to reduce the frequency of periodical table reads and speed up all silos learning about new joining silos and dead silos . Every time any silo writes anything successfully to the table (suspicion, new join, …) it also broadcasts to all other silos – “go and reread the table now”. The silo does NOT tell others what it wrote in the table (since this information could already be outdated/wrong), it just tells them to re-read the table. That way we learn very quickly about membership changes without the need to wait for the full periodic read cycle. We still need the periodic read, in case the “re-read the table” message gets lost. Properties of the Basic Membership Protocol and FAQ: Can handle any number of failures – our algorithm can handle any number of failures (that is, f<=n), including full cluster restart. This is in contrast with “traditional” Paxos based solutions, which require quorum, which is usually a majority. We have seen in production situations when more than half of the silos were down. Our system stayed functional, while Paxos based membership would not be able to make progress. Traffic to the table is very light - The actual pings go directly between servers and not to the table. This would generate a lot of traffic plus would be less accurate from the failure detection perspective - if a silo could not reach the table, it would miss to write its I am alive heartbeat and others would kill him. Tunable accuracy vs. completeness – both perfect and accurate failure detection is not possible in general . One usually wants an ability to tradeoff accuracy (don’t want to declare a silo that is really alive as dead) with completeness (want to declare dead a silo that is indeed dead as soon as possible). The configurable #votes to declare dead and #missed pings allows to trade those two. Scale - the basic protocol can handle thousands and probably even tens of thousands of servers. This is in contrast with traditional Paxos based solutions, such as group communication protocols, which are known not to scale beyond tens. Diagnostics - the table is also very convenient for diagnostics and troubleshooting. System administrator can instantaneously find in the table the current list of alive silos, as well as see the history of all killed silos and suspicions. This is especially useful when diagnosing problems. Why do we need reliable persistent storage for implementation of the MembershipTable ? - we use persistent storage (Azure table, SQL server or Apache ZooKeeper) for the MembershipTable for 2 purposes. First, it is used as a rendezvous point for silos to find each other and Orleans clients to find silos. Second, we use the reliable storage to help us coordinate the agreement on the membership view. While we perform failure detection directly in a peer to peer fashion between the silos, we store the membership view in a reliable storage and use the concurrency control mechanism provided by this storage to reach agreement of who is alive and who is dead. That way, in a sense, our protocol outsources the hard problem of distributed consensus to the cloud. In that we fully utilize the power of the underlying cloud platform, using it truly as \"Platform as a Service\". What happens if the table is not accessible for some time? (storage service is down, unavailable, or there are communication problems with it) – our protocol will NOT declare silos as dead by mistake in such a case. Currently operational silos will keep working without any problems. However, we won't be able to declare a silo dead (if we detected some silo is dead via missed pings we won’t be able to write this fact to the table) and also won't be able to allow new silos to join. So completeness will suffer, but accuracy will not - partitioning from the table will never cause us to declare silo as dead by mistake. Also, in case of a partial network partition (if some silos can access the table and some not), it could happen that we will declare a dead silo as dead, but it will take some time until all other silos learn about it. So detection could be delayed, but we will never wrongly kill someone due to table un-availability. Direct IAmAlive writes into the table for diagnostics only - in addition to heartbeats that are sent between the silos, each silo also periodically updates an \"I Am Alive\" column in his row in the table. This \"I Am Alive\" column is only used for manual troubleshooting and diagnostics and is not used by the membership protocol itself. It is usually written at much lower frequency (once every 5 minutes) and serves as a very useful tool for system administratosr to check the liveness of the cluster or easily find out when the silo was alive the last time. Extension to totally order membership views: The basic membership protocol described above was later extended to support totally ordered membership views. We will briefly describe the reasons for this extension and how it is implemented. The extension does not change anything in the above design, just adds an additional property that all membership configurations are globally totally ordered. Why it is useful to totally order membership views? This allows to serialize the joining of new silos to the cluster. That way, when a new silo joins the cluster it can validate two-way connectivity to every other silo that has already started. If some of the already joined silos do not answer it (potentially indicating a network connectivity problem with the new silo), the new silo is not allowed to join. This ensures that at least when a silo starts, there is a full connectivity between all silos in the cluster (this is implemented). Higher level protocols in the silo, such as distributed grain directory, can utilize the fact that membership views are ordered and use this information to perform smarter duplicate activations resolution. In particular, when directory finds out that 2 activations were created when membership was in flux, it may decide to deactivate the older activation that was created based on the now-outdated membership information (this is currently not implemented). Extended Membership Protocol: For implementation of this feature we utilize the support for transactions over multiple rows that is provided by the MembershipTable .. We add a membership-version row to the table that tracks table changes. When silo S wants to write suspicion or death declaration for silo P: 3.1 S reads the latest table content. If P is already dead, do nothing. Otherwise, 3.2 In the same transaction, write the changes to P's row as well as increment the version number and write it back to the table. 3.3 Both writes are conditioned with eTags. 3.4 If transaction aborts due to eTag mismatch on either P's row or on the version row, attempt again. All writes to the table modify and increment the version row. That way all writes to the table are serialized (via serializing the updates to the version row) and since silos only increment the version number, the writes are also totally ordered in increasing order. Scalability of the Extended Membership Protocol: In the extended version of the protocol all writes are serialized via one row. This can potentially heart the scalability of the cluster managemenet protocol, since it increases the risk of conflicts between concurrent table writes. To partially mitigate this problem silos retry all their writes to the table by using exponential backoff. We have observed the extended protocols to work smoothly in production environment in Azure with up to 200 silos. However, we do think the protocol might have problems to scale beyond a thousand silos. In such large setups the updates to version row may be easily disabled, essentially maintaining the rest of the cluster managemenet protocol and giving up on the total ordering property. Please also note that we refer here to the scalability of the cluster management protocol, not the rest of Orleans. We believe that other parts of the Orleans runtime (messaging, distributed directory, grain hosting, client to gateway connectivity) are scalable way beyond hundreds of silos. Membership Table: As already mentioned, MembershipTable is used as a rendezvous point for silos to find each other and Orleans clients to find silos and also helps coordinate the agreement on the membership view. We currently have5 implementation of the MembershipTable : based on Azure Table, SQL server, Apache ZooKeeper, Consul IO and in-memory emulation for development. The interface for MembershipTable is defined in IMembershipTable . Azure Table Storage - in this implementation we use Azure deployment ID as partition key and the silo identity ( ip:port:epoch ) as row key. Together they guarantee a unique key per silo. For concurrency control we use optimistic concurrency control based on Azure Table ETags . Every time we read from the table we store the etag for every read row and use that eTag when we try to write back. etags are automatically assigned and checked by Azure Table service on every write. For multi-row transactions we utilize the support for batch transactions provided by Azure table , which guarantees serializale transactions over rows with the same partition key. SQL Server - in this implementation the configured deployment ID is used to distinguish between deployments and which silos belong to which deployments. The silo identity is defined as a combination of deploymentID, ip, port, epoch in appropriate tables and columns. The relational backend uses optimistic concurrency control and transactions, similar to the procedure of using ETags on Azure Table implementation. The relational implementation expects the database engine to generate the ETag used. In case of SQL Server, on SQL Server 2000 the generated ETag is one acquired from a call to NEWID() . On SQL Server 2005 and later ROWVERSION is used. Orleans reads and writes relational ETags as opaque VARBINARY(16) tags and stores them in memory as base64 encoded strings. Orleans supports multi-row inserts using UNION ALL (for Oracle including DUAL), which is currently used to insert statistics data. The exact implementation and rationale for SQL Server can be seen at CreateOrleansTables_SqlServer.sql . Apache ZooKeeper - in this implementation we use the configured deployment ID as a root node and the silo identity ( ip:port@epoch ) as its child node. Together they guarantee a unique path per silo. For concurrency control we use optimistic concurrency control based on the node version . Every time we read from the deployment root node we store the version for every read child silo node and use that version when we try to write back. Each time a node's data changes, the version number increases atomically by the ZooKeeper service. For multi-row transactions we utilize the multi method , which guarantees serializale transactions over silo nodes with the same parent deployment ID node. Consul IO - we used Consul's Key/Value store to impelement the membershop table. Refer to Consul-Deployment for more details. In-memory emulation for development setup. We use a special system grain, called MembershipTableGrain , for that implementation. This grain lives on a designated primary silo, which is only used for a development setup . In any real production usage primary silo is not required . Configuration: Membership protocol is configured via the Liveness element in the Globals section in OrleansConfiguration.xml file. The default values were tuned in years of production usage in Azure and we believe they represent good default settings. There is no need in general to change them. Sample config element: <Liveness ProbeTimeout = \"5s\" TableRefreshTimeout =\"10s DeathVoteExpirationTimeout =\"80s\" NumMissedProbesLimit = \"3\" NumProbedSilos=\"3\" NumVotesForDeathDeclaration=\"2\" /> There are 4 types of liveness implemented. The type of the liveness protocol is configured via the SystemStoreType attribute of the SystemStore element in the Globals section in OrleansConfiguration.xml file. MembershipTableGrain - membership table is stored in a grain on primary silo. This is a development setup only . AzureTable - membership table is stored in Azure table. SqlServer - membership table is stored in a relational database. ZooKeeper - membership table is stored in a ZooKeeper ensemble . Consul - configured as Custom system store with MembershipTableAssembly = \"OrleansConsulUtils\" . Refer to Consul-Deployment for more details. For all liveness types the common configuration variables are defined in Globals.Liveness element: ProbeTimeout - The number of seconds to probe other silos for their liveness or for the silo to send \"I am alive\" heartbeat messages about itself. Default is 10 seconds. TableRefreshTimeout - The number of seconds to fetch updates from the membership table. Default is 60 seconds. DeathVoteExpirationTimeout - Expiration time in seconds for death vote in the membership table. Default is 120 seconds NumMissedProbesLimi t - The number of missed \"I am alive\" heartbeat messages from a silo or number of un-replied probes that lead to suspecting this silo as dead. Default is 3. NumProbedSilos - The number of silos each silo probes for liveness. Default is 3. NumVotesForDeathDeclaration - The number of non-expired votes that are needed to declare some silo as dead (should be at most NumMissedProbesLimit). Default is 2. UseLivenessGossip - Whether to use the gossip optimization to speed up spreading liveness information. Default is true. IAmAliveTablePublishTimeout - The number of seconds to periodically write in the membership table that this silo is alive. Used only for diagnostics. Default is 5 minutes. NumMissedTableIAmAliveLimit - The number of missed \"I am alive\" updates in the table from a silo that causes warning to be logged. Does not impact the liveness protocol. Default is 2. MaxJoinAttemptTime - The number of seconds to attempt to join a cluster of silos before giving up. Default is 5 minutes. ExpectedClusterSize - The expected size of a cluster. Need not be very accurate, can be an overestimate. Used to tune the exponential backoff algorithm of retries to write to Azure table. Default is 20. Design Rationale: A natural question that might be asked is why not to rely completely on Apache ZooKeeper for the cluster membership implementation, potentially by using it's out of the box support for group membership with ephemeral nodes ? Why did we bother implementing our own membership protocol? There were primarily three reasons: 1) Deployment/Hosting in the Cloud - Zookeeper is not a hosted service (at least at the time of this writing July 2015 and definitely when we first implemented this protocol in the summer of 2011 there was no version of Zookeeper running as a hosted service by any major cloud provider). It means that in the Cloud environment Orleans customers would have to deploy/run/manage their own instance of a ZK cluster. This is just yet another unnecessary burden, that we did not want to force on our customers. By using Azure Table we rely on a hosted, managed service which makes our customers lives much simpler. Basically, in the Cloud, use Cloud as a Platform, not as an Infrastructure. On the other hand, when running on premises and managing your own servers, relying on ZK as an implementation of the MembershipTable is a viable option. 2) Direct failure detection - when using ZK's group membership with ephemeral nodes the failure detection is performed between the Orleans servers (ZK clients) and ZK servers. This may not necessarily correlate with the actual network problems between Orleans servers. Our desire was that the failure detection would accurately reflect the intra-cluster state of the communication. Specifically, in our design, if an Orleans silo cannot communicate with the MembershipTable it is not considered dead and can keep working. As opposite to that, have we used ZK group membership with ephemeral nodes a disconnection from a ZK server may cause an Orleans silo (ZK client) to be declared dead, while it may actually be alive and fully functional. 3) Portability and flexibility - as part of Orleans's philosophy, we do not want to force a strong dependence on any particular technology, but rather have a flexible design where different components can be easily switched with different implementations. This is exactly the purpuse that MembershipTable abstraction serves. Acknowledgements: We would to acknowledge the contribution of Alex Kogan to the design and implementation of the first version of this protocol.

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc This guide will show you a quick way to setup and use Orleans Streams. To learn more about the details of the streaming features, read other parts of this documentation. Required Configurations In this guide we'll use a Simple Message based Stream which uses grain messaging to send stream data to subscribers. We will use the in-memory storage provider to store lists of subscriptions so it is not a wise choise for real production applications. <Globals> <StorageProviders> <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.MemoryStorage\" Name=\"Default\" /> <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.MemoryStorage\" Name=\"PubSubStore\" /> </StorageProviders> <StreamProviders> <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Providers.Streams.SimpleMessageStream.SimpleMessageStreamProvider\" Name=\"SMSProvider\"/> </StreamProviders> Now we can create streams, send data using them as producers and also receive data as subscribers. Producing Events Producing events for streams is relatively easy. You should first get access to the stream provider which you defined in the config above ( SMSProvider ) and then choose a stream and push data to it. //Pick a guid for a chat room grain and chat room stream var guid = some guid identifying the chat room //Get one of the providers which we defined in config var streamProvider = GetStreamProvider(\"SMSProvider\"); //Get the reference to a stream var stream = streamProvider.GetStream<int>(guid, \"RANDOMDATA\"); As you can see our stream has a GUID and a namespace. This will make it easy to identify unique streams. For example, in a chat room namespace can \"Rooms\" and GUID be the owning RoomGrain's GUID. Here we use the GUID of some known chat room. Now using the OnNext method of the stream we can push data to it. Let's do it inside a timer and using random numbers. You could use any other data type for the stream as well. RegisterTimer(s => { return stream.OnNextAsync(new System.Random().Next()); }, null, TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1000), TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1000)); Subscribing and receiving streaming data For receiving data we can use implicit/explicit subscriptions, which are fully described in other pages of the manual. Here we use implicit subscriptions which are easier. When a grain type wants to implicitly subscribe to a stream it uses the attribute ImplicitStreamSubscription (namespace)] . For our case we'll define a ReceiverGrain like this: [ImplicitStreamSubscription(\"RANDOMDATA\")] public class ReceiverGrain : Grain, IRandomReceiver Now whenever some data is pushed to the streams of namespace RANDOMDATA as we have in the timer, a grain of type ReceiverGrain with the same guid of the stream will receive the message. Even if no activations of the grain currently exist, the runtime will automatically create a new one and send the message to it. In order for this to work however, we need to complete the subscription process by setting our OnNext method for receiving data. So our ReceiverGrain should call in its OnActivateAsync something like this //Create a GUID based on our GUID as a grain var guid = this.GetPrimaryKey(); //Get one of the providers which we defined in config var streamProvider = GetStreamProvider(\"SMSProvider\"); //Get the reference to a stream var stream = streamProvider.GetStream<int>(guid, \"RANDOMDATA\"); //Set our OnNext method to the lambda which simply prints the data, this doesn't make new subscriptions await stream.SubscribeAsync<int>(async (data, token) => Console.WriteLine(data)); We are all set now. The only requirement is that something triggers our producer grain's creation and then it will registers the timer and starts sending random ints to all interested parties. Again, this guide skips lots of details and is only good for showing the big picture. Read other parts of this manual and other resources on RX to gain a good understanding on what is available and how. Reactive programming can be a very powerful approach to solve many problems. You could for example use LINQ in the subscriber to filter numbers and do all sorts of interesting stuff. Next Orleans Streams Programming APIs"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Applications interact with streams via APIs that are very similar to the well known Reactive Extensions (Rx) in .NET . The main difference is that Orleans stream extensions are asynchronous , to make processing more efficient in Orleans' distributed and scalable compute fabric. Async Stream An application starts by using a stream provider to get a handle to a stream. You can read more about stream providers here , but for now you can think of it as stream factory that allows implementers to customize streams behavior and semantics: IStreamProvider streamProvider = base.GetStreamProvider(\"SimpleStreamProvider\"); IAsyncStream<T> stream = streamProvider.GetStream<T>(Guid, \"MyStreamNamespace\"); Application can get a reference to the stream provider either by calling the GetStreamProvider method on the Grain class when inside a grain, or by calling GrainClient.GetStreamProvider() method when on the client. Orleans.Streams.IAsyncStream<T> is a logical, strongly-typed handle to a virtual stream . It is similar in spirit to Orleans Grain Reference. Calls to GetStreamProvider and GetStream are purely local. The arguments to GetStream are a GUID and an additional string that we call a stream namespace (which can be null). Together the GUID and the namespace string comprise the stream identity (similar in sprit to the arguments to GrainFactory.GetGrain ). The combination of GUID and namespace string provide extra flexibility in determining stream identities. Just like grain 7 may exist within the Grain type PlayerGrain and a different grain 7 may exist within the grain type ChatRoomGrain , Stream 123 may exist with the stream namespace PlayerEventsStream and a different stream 123 may exist within the stream namespace ChatRoomMessagesStream . Producing and Consuming IAsyncStream<T> implements both Orleans.Streams.IAsyncObserver<T> and Orleans.Streams.IAsyncObservable<T> interfaces. That way an application can use the stream either to produce new events into the stream by using Orleans.Streams.IAsyncObserver<T> or to subscribe to and consume events from a stream by using Orleans.Streams.IAsyncObservable<T> . public interface IAsyncObserver<in T> { Task OnNextAsync(T item, StreamSequenceToken token = null); Task OnCompletedAsync(); Task OnErrorAsync(Exception ex); } public interface IAsyncObservable<T> { Task<StreamSubscriptionHandle<T>> SubscribeAsync(IAsyncObserver<T> observer); } To produce events into the stream, an application just calls await stream.OnNextAsync<T>(event) To subscribe to a stream, an application calls StreamSubscriptionHandle<T> subscriptionHandle = await stream.SubscribeAsync(IAsyncObserver) The argument to SubscribeAsync can either be an object that implements the IAsyncObserver interface or a combination of lambda functions to process incoming events. More options for SubscribeAsync are available via AsyncObservableExtensions class. SubscribeAsync returns a StreamSubscriptionHandle<T> , which is an opaque handle that can be used to unsubscribe from the stream (similar in spirit to an asynchronous version of IDisposable ). await subscriptionHandle.UnsubscribeAsync() It is important to note that the subscription is for a grain, not for an activation . Once the grain code subscribed to the stream, this subscription surpasses the life of this activation and stays durable forever, until the grain code (potentially in a different activation) explicitly unsubscribes. This is the heart of a virtual stream abstraction : not only all the streams always exits, logically, but also that a stream subscription is durable and lives beyond a particular physical activation that issued this subscription. Multiplicity An Orleans stream may have multiple producers and multiple consumers. A message published by a producer will be delivered to all consumers that were subscribed to the stream before the message was published. In addition, the consumer can subscribe to the same stream multiple times. Each time it subscribes it gets back a unique StreamSubscriptionHandle<T> . If a grain (or client) is subscribed X times to the same stream, it will receive the same event X times, once for each subscription. The consumer can also unsubscribe from an individual subscription or find out all its current subscriptions, by calling: IList<StreamSubscriptionHandle<T>> allMyHandles = await IAsyncStream<T>.GetAllSubscriptionHandles() Recovering From Failures If the producer of a stream dies (or its grain is deactivated), there is nothing it needs to do. Next time this grain wants to produce more events it can get the stream handle again and produce new events in the same way. Consumer logic is a little bit more involved. As we said before, once consumer grain subscribed to a stream, this subscription is valid until it explicitly unsubscribes. If the consumer of the stream dies (or its grain is deactivated) and new event is generated on the stream, the consumer grain will be automatically re-activated (just like any regular Orleans grain is automatically activated upon message to it). The only thing that the grain code needs to do now is to provide a IAsyncObserver<T> to process the data. The consumer basically need to re-attach processing logic as part of OnActivateAsync method. To do that it can call: StreamSubscriptionHandle<int> newHandle = await subscriptionHandle.ResumeAsync(IAsyncObserver) The consumer uses the previous handle it got when it first subscribed in order to \"resume processing\". Notice that ResumeAsync merely updates an existing subscription with the new instance of IAsyncObserver logic and does not change the fact that this consumer is already subscribed to this stream. How the consumer has an old subscriptionHandle? There are 2 options. The consumer may have persisted the handle it was given back from the original SubscribeAsync operation and can use it now. Alternatively, if the consumer does not have the handle, it can ask the IAsyncStream<T> for all its active subscription handles, by calling: IList<StreamSubscriptionHandle<T>> allMyHandles = await IAsyncStream<T>.GetAllSubscriptionHandles() The consumer can now resume all of them, or unsubscribe from some if he wishes to. COMMENT: If the consumer grain implements the the IAsyncObserver interface directly ( public class MyGrain<T> : Grain, IAsyncObserver<T> ), it should in theory not be required to re-attach the IAsyncObserver and thus will not need to call ResumeAsync . The streaming runtime should be able to automatically figure out that the grain already implements IAsyncObserver and will just invoke those IAsyncObserver methods. However, the streaming runtime currently does not support this and the grain code still needs to explicitly call ResumeAsync , even if the grain implements IAsyncObserver directly. Supporting this is on our TODO list. Explicit and Implicit Subscriptions By default, stream consumer has to explicitly subscribe to the stream. This subscription would usually be triggered by some external message that the grain (or client) receive that instructs them to subscribe. For example, in a chat service when user joins a chat room his grain receives a JoinChatGroup message with the chat name and it will cause the user grain to subscribe to this chat stream. In addition, Orleans Streams also support \"Implicit Subscriptions\" . In this model the grain does not explicitely subscribe to the stream. This grain is subscribed automatically, implicitly, just based on its grain identity and an ImplicitStreamSubscription attribute. Implicit subscriptions main value is allowing the stream activity to trigger the grain activation (hence triggering the subscription) automaticaly. For example, using SMS streams, if one grain wanted to produce a stream and another grain process this stream, the producer would need to know the identity of the consumer grain and make a grain call to it telling it to subscribe to the stream. Only after that it can start sending events. Instead, using implicit subscriptions, the producer can just start producing events onto a stream, and the consumer grain will automatically be activated and subscribe to the stream. In that case, the producer doesn't care at all who is reading the events Grain implementation class of type MyGrainType can declare an attribute [ImplicitStreamSubscription(\"MyStreamNamespace\")] . This tells the streaming runtime that when an event is generated on a stream whose identity is GUID XXX and \"MyStreamNamespace\" namespace, it should be delivered to grain whose identity is XXX of type MyGrainType . That is, the runtime maps stream <XXX, MyStreamNamespace> to consumer grain <XXX, MyGrainType> . The presence of ImplicitStreamSubscription causes the streaming runtime to automatically subscribe this grain to a stream and deliver the stream events to it. However, the grain code still needs to tell the runtime how it wants events to be processed. Essentially, it need to attach the IAsyncObserver . Therefore, when the grain is activated, the grain code inside OnActivateAsync needs to call: IStreamProvider streamProvider = base.GetStreamProvider(\"SimpleStreamProvider\"); IAsyncStream<T> stream = streamProvider.GetStream<T>(this.GetPrimaryKey(), \"MyStreamNamespace\"); StreamSubscriptionHandle<T> subscription = await stream.SubscribeAsync(IAsyncObserver<T>); Writing Subscription Logic Below are the guidlines on how to write the subscription logic for varios cases: explicit and implicit subscriptions, rewindable and non-rewindable streams. The main difference between explicit and implicit subscriptions is that for implicit the grain always has exactly one implicit subscription for every stream namespace, there is no way to create multiple subsriptions (there is no subscription multiplicity) and the grain logic always only needs to attach the processing logic. That also means that for implicit subscriptions there is never a need to Resume a subsription. On the other hand, for explicit subscriptions, one needs to Resume the subscription, otherwise if the grain subsribes again it will result in the grain being subscribed multipe times. Implicit Subscriptions: For implicit subscriptions case the grain needs to subscribe in order to attach the processing logic. This should be done in the grain's OnActivateAsync method. The grain should simply execute await stream.SubscribeAsync(OnNext ...) in its OnActivateAsync method. That will cause this particular activation to attach the OnNext function to process that stream. The grain can optionaly specify the StreamSequenceToken as an argument to SubscribeAsync , which will cause this implicit subscriptions to start consuming from that token. There is never a need for implicit subscriptions to call ResumeAsync . public async override Task OnActivateAsync() { var streamProvider = GetStreamProvider(PROVIDER_NAME); var stream = streamProvider.GetStream<string>(this.GetPrimaryKey(), \"MyStreamNamespace\"); await x.SubscribeAsync(OnNextAsync) } Explicit Subscriptions: Grain that wants to explicitly subscribe first has to call SubscribeAsync in some place in its code, in order to subsribe the first time. This causes the subsription to be established, as well as attaches the processig logic. Now imagine a case when the grain got deactivated and reactivated. The grain is still explicitly subscribed, but no processig logic is attached. The grain needs to re-attach the processing logic. To do that, in its OnActivateAsync , the grain first needs to find out what subscriptions it has, by calling stream.GetAllSubscriptionHandles() . Then the grain has to execute ResumeAsync on each handle. The grain can also optionaly specify the StreamSequenceToken as an argument to SubscribeAsync , which will cause this explicit subscription to start consuming from that token. public async override Task OnActivateAsync() { var streamProvider = GetStreamProvider(PROVIDER_NAME); var stream = streamProvider.GetStream<string>(this.GetPrimaryKey(), \"MyStreamNamespace\"); var subscriptionHandles = await stream.GetAllSubscriptionHandles(); if (!subscriptionHandles.IsNullOrEmpty()) subscriptionHandles.ForEach(async x => await x.ResumeAsync(OnNextAsync)); } Stream Order and Sequence Tokens The order of events delivery between an individual producer and an individual consumer depends on a stream provider. With SMS the producer explicitly controls the order of events seen by the consumer by controlling the way he publishes them. By default (if the FireAndForget options for SMS provider is set to false) and if the producer awaits every OnNextAsync call, the events arrive in FIFO order. In SMS it is up to the producer to decide how to handle delivery failures that will be indicated by a broken Task returned by the OnNextAsync call. Azure Queue streams do not guarantee FIFO order, since the underlying Azure Queues do not guarantee order in failure cases (they do guarantee FIFO order in failure free executions). When a producer produces the event into Azure Queue, if the enqueue operation failed, it is up to the producer to attempt another enqueue and later on deal with potential duplicates messages. On the delivery side, Orleans Streaming runtime dequeues the event from the Azure Queue and attempts to deliver it for processing to consumers. Orleans Streaming runtime deletes the event from the queue only upon successful processing. If the delivery or processing failed, the event is not delete from the queue and will automatically re-appear in the queue much later. The Streaming runtime will try to deliver it again, thus potentially breaking the FIFO order. The described behaivour matches the regular semantics of Azure Queues. Application Defined Order : To deal with the above ordering issues, application can optionally specify its own ordering. This is achived via a notion of StreamSequenceToken . StreamSequenceToken is an opaque IComparable object that can be used to order events. A producer can pass an optional StreamSequenceToken to the OnNext call. This StreamSequenceToken will be passed all the way to the consumer and will be delivered together with the event. That way, application can reason and reconstruct it's order independently from the streaming runtime. Rewindable Streams Some streams only allow application to subscribe to them starting at the latest point in time, while other streams allow \"going back in time\". The latter capability is dependent on the underlying queuing technology and the particular stream provider. For example, Azure Queues only allow consuming the latest enqueued events, while EventHub allows replaying events from an arbitrary point in time (up to some expiration time). Streams that support going back in time are called Rewindable Streams . The consumer of a rewindable stream can pass a StreamSequenceToken to the SubscribeAsync call and the runtime will deliver events to it starting from that StreamSequenceToken (a null token means the consumer wants to receive events starting from the latest). The ability to rewind a stream is very useful in recovery scenarios. For example, consider a grain that subscribes to a stream and periodically checkpoints its state together with the latest sequence token. When recovering from a failure, the grain can re-subscribe to the same stream from the latest checkpointed sequence token, thereby recovering without losing any events that were generated since the last checkpoint. Current Status of Rewindable Streams: Both SMS and Azure Queue providers are not-rewindable and Orleans currently does not include an implementation of rewindable streams. We are actively working on this. Stateless Automatically Scaled-Out Processing By default Orleans Streaming is targeted to support a large number of relatively small streams, each is processed by one or more statefull grains. Collectively, the processing of all the streams together is sharded among a large number of regular (statefull) grains. The application code controls this sharding by assigning stream ids, grain ids and explicitly subscribing. The goal is sharded statefull processing . However, there is also an interesting scenario of automatically scaled-out stateless processing . In this scenario application has a small number of streams (or even one large stream) and the goal is stateless processing. For example, a global stream of all messages for all events and the processing involving some kind of decoding/deciphering and potentially forwarding them for further statefull processing into another set of streams. The stateless scaled-out stream processing can be supported in Orleans via StatelessWorker grains. Current Status of Stateless Automatically Scaled-Out Processing: This is currently not implemented (due to priority constrains). An attempt to subscribe to a stream from a StatelessWorker grain will result in undefined behavior. We are currently considering to support this option . Grains and Orleans Clients Orleans streams work uniformly across grains and Orleans clients . That is, exactly the same APIs can be used inside a grain and in an Orleans client to produce and consume events. This greatly simplifies the application logic, making special client-side APIs, such as Grain Observers, redundant. Fully Managed and Reliable Streaming Pub-Sub To track stream subscriptions, Orleans uses a runtime component called Streaming Pub-Sub which serves as a rendezvous point for stream consumers and stream producers. Pub Sub tracks all stream subscriptions, persists them, and matches stream consumers with stream producers. Applications can choose where and how the Pub-Sub data is stored. The Pub-Sub component itself is implemented as grains (called PubSubRendezvousGrain ) and it is using Orleans Declarative Persistence for those grain. PubSubRendezvousGrain uses storage provider named PubSubStore . As with any grain, you can designate an implementation for a storage provider. For Streaming Pub-Sub you can change the implementation of the PubSubStore in the config file: <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <StorageProviders> <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.AzureTableStorage\" Name=\"PubSubStore\" /> </StorageProviders> </Globals> </OrleansConfiguration> That way Pub-Sub data will be durably stored in Azure Table. For initial development you can use the memory storage as well. In addition to the Pub-Sub, Orleans Streaming Runtime delivers events from producers to consumers, manages all runtime resources allocated to actively used streams, and transparently garbage collects runtime resources from unused streams. Configuration In order to use streams you need to enable stream providers via configuration. You can read more about stream providers here . Sample stream providers configuration: <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <StreamProviders> <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Providers.Streams.SimpleMessageStream.SimpleMessageStreamProvider\" Name=\"SMSProvider\"/> <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Providers.Streams.AzureQueue.AzureQueueStreamProvider\" Name=\"AzureQueueProvider\"/> </StreamProviders> </Globals> </OrleansConfiguration> It is also possible to register a stream provider programmatically, via calling one of the RegisterStreamProvider methods on the Orleans.Runtime.Configuration.GlobalConfiguration or Orleans.Runtime.Configuration.ClientConfiguration classes. public void RegisterStreamProvider(string providerTypeFullName, string providerName, IDictionary<string, string> properties = null) public void RegisterStreamProvider<T>(string providerName, IDictionary<string, string> properties = null) where T : IStreamProvider Next Orleans Stream Providers"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc This section provides a high level overview of Orleans Stream implementation. It describes concepts and details that are not visible on the application level. If you only plan to use streams, you do not have to read this section. However, if you plan to extend streams, please read this section before reading Streams Extensibility section . Terminology : We refer by the word \"queue\" to any durable storage technology that can ingest stream events and allows either to pull events or provides a push-based mechanism to consume events. Usually, to provide scalability, those technologies provide sharded/partitions queues. For example, Azure Queues allow to create multiple queues, Event Hubs have multiple hubs, Kafka topics, ... Persistent Streams All Orleans Persistent Stream Providers share a common implementation PersistentStreamProvider . This generic stream provider is parametrized with a technology specific IQueueAdapter . When stream producer generates a new stream item and calls stream.OnNext() , Orleans Streaming Runtime invokes the appropriate method on the IQueueAdapter of that stream provider that enqueues the item directly into an appropriate queue. Pulling Agents At the heart of the Persistent Stream Provider are the pulling agents. Pulling agents pull events from a set of durable queues and deliver them to the application code in grains that consumes them. One can think of the pulling agents as a distributed \"micro-service\" -- a partitioned, highly available, and elastic distributed component. The pulling agents run inside the same silos that host application grains and are fully managed by the Orleans Streaming Runtime. StreamQueueMapper and StreamQueueBalancer Pulling agents are parametrized with IStreamQueueMapper and StreamQueueBalancerType . IStreamQueueMapper provides a list of all queues and is also responsible for mapping streams to queues. That way, the producer side of the Persistent Stream Provider know which queue to enqueue the message into. StreamQueueBalancerType expresses the way queues are balanced across Orleans silos and agents. The goal is to assign queues to agents in a balanced way, to prevent bottlenecks and support elasticity. When new silo is added to the Orleans cluster, queues are automatically rebalanced across the old and new silos. StreamQueueBalancer allows to customize that process. Orleans has a number of built in StreamQueueBalancers, to support different balancing scenarios (large and small number of queues) and different environments (Azure, on prem, static). Pulling Protocol Every silo runs a set of pulling agents, every agent is pulling from one queue. Pulling agents themselves are implemented by the internal runtime component, called SystemTarget . SystemTargets are essentially runtime grains, are subject to single threaded concurrency, can use regular grain messaging and are as lightweight as grains. As opposite to grain, SystemTargets are not virtual: they are explicitly created (by the runtime) and are also not location transparent. By implementing pulling agents as SystemTargets Orleans Streaming Runtime can rely on a lot of built-in Orleans features and can also scale to a very large number of queues, since creating a new pulling agent is as cheap as creating a new grain. Every pulling agent runs periodic timer that pulls from the queue (by invoking IQueueAdapterReceiver ) GetQueueMessagesAsync() method. The returned messages are put in the internal per-agent data structure called IQueueCache . Every message is inspected to find out its destination stream. The agent uses the Pub Sub to find out the list of stream consumers that subscribed to this stream. Once the consumer list if retrieved, the agent stores it locally (in its pub-sub cache) so it does not need to consult with Pub Sub on every message. The agent also subscribes with the pub-sub to receive notification of any new consumers that subscribe to that stream. This handshake between the agent and the pub-sub guarantees strong streaming subscription semantics : once the consumer has subscribed to the stream it will see all events that were generated after it has subscribed (in addition, using StreamSequenceToken allows to subscribe in the past). Queue Cache IQueueCache is an internal per-agent data structure that allows to decouple bringing new events from the queue from delivering them to consumers. It also allows to decouple delivery to different streams and to different consumers. Imagine a situation when one stream has 3 stream consumers and one of them is slow. If care not taken, it is possible that this slow consumer will impact agent's progress, slowing the consumption of other consumers of that stream, and even potentially slowing the de-queuing and delivering of events for other stream. To prevent that and allow maximum parallelism in the agent, we use IQueueCache . IQueueCache buffers stream events and provides a way to the agent to deliver events to each consumer at its pace. The per-consumer delivery is implemented by the internal component called IQueueCacheCursor , which tracks per consumer progress. That way each consumer receives events at its own pace :fast consumers receive events as quickly as they are dequeued from the queue, while slow consumers receive them later on. Once the message was delivered to all consumers, it can be deleted from the cache. Backpressure Backpressure in Orleans Streaming Runtime applies in two places: bringing stream events from the queue to the agent and delivering the events from the agent to stream consumers . The latter is provided by the built-in Orleans messaging delivery mechanism. Every stream event is delivered from the agent to consumers via the standard Orleans grain messaging, one at a time. That is, the agents sends one event (or a limited size batch of events) to each individual stream consumer and awaits this call. The next event will not start being delivered until the Task for the previous event was resolved or broken. That way we naturally limit the per-consumer delivery rate to one message at a time. With regard to bringing stream events from the queue to the agent Orleans Streaming provides a new special Backpressure mechanism. Since the agent decouples de-queuing of events from the queue and delivering them to consumers, it is possible that a single slow consumer will fall behind so much that the IQueueCache will fill up. To prevent IQueueCache from growing indefinitely, we limit its size (the size limit is configurable). However, the agent never throws away undelivered events. Instead, when the cache starts to fill up, the agents slows the rate of dequeing events from the queue. That way, we can \"ride\" the slow delivery periods by adjusting the rate at which we consume from the queue (\"backpressure\") and get back into fast consumption rate later on. To detect the \"slow delivery\" valleys the IQueueCache uses an internal data structure of cache buckets that track the progress of delivery of events to individual stream consumer. This results in a very responsive and self-adjusting systems. Next Orleans Streams Extensibility"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc There are three ways developers can extend the currently implemented behaviour of Orleans Streaming: Utilize or extend Stream Provider Configuration. Write a Custom Queue Adapter. Writ a New Stream Provider We will describe those below. Please read the Orleans Streams Implementation before reading this section to have a high level view of the internal implementation. Stream Provider Configuration Currently implemented stream providers support a number of configuration options. Simple Message Stream Provider Configuration . SMS Stream Provider currently supports only a single configuration option: FireAndForgetDelivery : this option specifies if the messages sent by SMS stream producer are sent as fire and forget without the way to know if they were delivered or not. When FireAndForgetDelivery is set to false (messages are sent not as FireAndForget), the stream producer's call stream.OnNext() returns a Task that represents the processing status of the stream consumer. If this Task succeeds, the producer knows for sure that the message was delivered and processed successfully. If FireAndForgetDelivery is set to true, the returned Task only expresses that the Orleans runtime has accepted the message and queued it for further delivery. The default value for FireAndForgetDelivery is false. Persistent Stream Provider Configuration . All persistent stream providers support the following configuration options: GetQueueMessagesTimerPeriod - how much time the pulling agents wait after the last attempt to pull from the queue that did not return any items before the agent attempts to pull again. Default is 100 milliseconds. InitQueueTimeout - how much time the pulling agents waits for the adapter to initialize the connection with the queue. Default is 5 seconds. QueueBalancerType - the type of balancing algorithm to be used to balance queues to silos and agents. Default is ConsistentRingBalancer. Azure Queue Stream Provider Configuration . Azure Queue stream provider supports the following configuration options, in addition to what is supported by Persistent Stream Provider: DataConnectionString - the Azure Queue storage connection string. DeploymentId - the deployment id of this Orleans cluster (usually similar to Azure Deployment Id). CacheSize - the size of the persistent provider cache that is used to store stream message for further delivery. Default is 4096. It would be totally possible and a lot of times easy to provide additional configuration options. For example, in some scenarios developers might want more control over queue names used by the Queue Adapter. This is currently abstracted away with IStreamQueueMapper , but there is currently no way to configure which IStreamQueueMapper to use without writing a new code. We would be happy to provide such an option, if needed. So please consider adding more configuration options to existing stream providers before writing a completely new provider. Writing a Custom Queue Adapter If you want to use a different queueing technology, you need to write a queue adapter that abstracts away the access to that queue. Below we provide details on how this should be done. Please refer to AzureQueueAdapterFactory for an example. Start by defining a MyQueueFactory class that implements IQueueAdapterFactory . You need to: a. Initialize the factory: read the passed config values, potentially allocate some data structures if you need to, etc. b. Implement a method that returns your IQueueAdapter . c. Implement a method that returns IQueueAdapterCache . Theoretically, you can build your own IQueueAdapterCache , but you don't have to. It is a good idea just to allocate and return an Orleans SimpleQueueAdapterCache . d. Implement a method that returns IStreamQueueMapper . Again, it is theoretically possible to build your own IStreamQueueMapper , but you don't have to. It is a good idea just to allocate and return an Orleans HashRingBasedStreamQueueMapper . Implement MyQueueAdapter class that implements the IQueueAdapter interface, which is an interfaces that manages access to a sharded queue . IQueueAdapter manages access to a set of queues/queue partitions (those are the queues that were returned by IStreamQueueMapper ). It provides an ability to enqueue a message in a specified the queue and create an IQueueAdapterReceiver for a particular queue. Implement MyQueueAdapterReceiver class that implements the IQueueAdapterReceiver , which is an interfaces that manages access to one queue (one queue partition) . In addition to initialization and shutdown, it basically provides one method: retrieve up to maxCount messages from the queue. Declare public class MyQueueStreamProvider : PersistentStreamProvider<MyQueueFactory> . This is your new Stream Provider. Configuration : in order to load and use you new stream provider you need to configure it properly via silo config file. If you need to use it on the client, you need to add a similar config element to the client config file. It is also possible to configure the stream provider programmatically. Below is an example of silo configuration: <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <StreamProviders> <Provider Type=\"My.App.MyQueueStreamProvider\" Name=\"MyStreamProvider\" GetQueueMessagesTimerPeriod=\"100ms\" AdditionalProperty=\"MyProperty\"/> </StreamProviders> </Globals> </OrleansConfiguration> Writing a Completely New Stream Provider It is also possible to write a completely new Stream Provider. In such a case there is very little integration that needs to be done from Orleans perspective. You just need to implement the IStreamProviderImpl interface, which is a thin interface that allows application code to get a handle to the stream. Beyond that, it is totally up to you how to implement it. Implementing a completely new Stream Provider might turn to be a rather complicated task, since you might need access to various internal runtime components, some of which may have internal access. We currently do not envision scenarios where one would need to implement a completely new Stream Provider and could not instead achieve his goals through the two options outlined above: either via extended configuration or by writing a Queue Adapter. However, if you think you have such a scenario, we would like to hear about it and work together on simplifying writing new Stream Providers."

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Stream Providers Streams can come in different shapes and forms. Some streams may deliver events over direct TCP links, while others deliver events via durable queues. Different stream types may use different batching strategies, different caching algorithms, or different back pressure procedures. We did not want to constrain streaming applications to only a small subset of those behavioral choices. Instead, Stream Providers are extensibility points to Orleans Streaming Runtime that allow users to implement any type of stream. This extensibility point is similar in spirit to Orleans Storage Providers . Orleans currently ships with two default stream providers: Simple Message Stream Provider and Azure Queue Stream Provider . Simple Message Stream Provider Simple Message Stream Provider, also known as the SMS provider, delivers events over TCP by utilizing regular Orleans grain messaging. Since events in SMS are delivered over unreliable TCP links, SMS does not guarantee reliable event delivery and does not automaticaly resend failed messages for SMS streams. The producer of the SMS stream has a way to know if his event was successfully received and processed or not: by default the call to stream.OnNextAsync returns a Task that represents the processing status of the stream consumer. If this Task fails, the producer can decide to send the same event again, thus achieving reliability on ther application level. Although individual stream messages delivery is best effort, SMS streams themselves are reliable. That is, the subscriber-to-producer binding performed by Pub Sub is fully reliable. Azure Queue (AQ) Stream Provider Azure Queue (AQ) Stream Provider delivers events over Azure Queues. On the producer side, AQ Stream Provider enqueues events directly into Azure Queue. On the consumer side, AQ Stream Provider manages a set of pulling agents that pull events from a set of Azure Queues and deliver them to application code that consumes them. One can think of the pulling agents as a distributed \"micro-service\" -- a partitioned, highly available, and elastic distributed component. The pulling agents run inside the same silos that host application grains. Thus, there is no need to run separate Azure worker roles to pull from the queues. The existence of pulling agents, their management, backpresure, balancing the queues between them, and handing off queues from a failed agent to another agent are fully managed by Orleans Streaming Runtime and are transparent to application code that uses streams. Queue Adapters Different stream providers that deliver events over durable queues exhibit similar behavior and are subject to a similar implementation. Therefore, we provide a generic extensible PersistentStreamProvider that allows developers to plug in different types of queues without writing a completely new stream provider from scratch. PersistentStreamProvider is parameterized with an IQueueAdapter , which abstracts specific queue implementation details and provides means to enqueue and dequeue events. All the rest is handled by the logic inside the PersistentStreamProvider . Azure Queue Provider mentioned above is also implemented this way: it is an instance of PersistentStreamProvider with AzureQueueAdapter . Next Orleans Streams Implementation Details"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Orleans v.1.0.0 added support for streaming extensions to the programing model. Streaming extensions provide a set of abstractions and APIs that make thinking about and working with streams simpler and more robust. Streaming extensions allow developers to write reactive applications that operate on a sequence of events in a structured way. The extensibility model of stream providers makes the programming model compatible with and portable across a wide range of existing queuing technologies, such as Event Hubs , ServiceBus , Azure Queues , and Apache Kafka . There is no need to write special code or run dedicated processes to interact with such queues. Why should I care? If you already know all about Stream Processing and are familiar with technologies like Event Hubs , Kafka , Azure Stream Analytics , Apache Storm , Apache Spark Streaming , and Reactive Extensions (Rx) in .NET , you may be asking why should you care. Why do we need yet another Stream Processing System and how Actors are related to Streams? \"Why Orleans Streams?\" is meant to answer that question. Programming Model There is a number of principles behind Orleans Streams Programming Model. Following the philosophy of Orleans virtual actors , Orleans streams are virtual . That is, a stream always exists. It is not explicitly created or destroyed, and it can never fail. Streams are identified by stream IDs, which are just logical names comprised of GUIDs and strings. Orleans Streams allow to decouple generation of data from its processing both in time and space . That means that stream producer and stream consumer may be on different servers, in different times and will withstand failures. Orleans streams are lightweight and dynamic . Orleans Streaming Runtime is designed to handle a large number of streams that come and go at a high rate. Orleans stream bindings are dynamic . Orleans Streaming Runtime is designed to handle cases where grains connect to and disconnect from streams at a high rate. Orleans Streaming Runtime transparently manages the lifecycle of stream consumption . After an application subscribes to a stream, from then on it will receive the stream's events, even in presence of failures. Orleans streams work uniformly across grains and Orleans clients . Programming APIs Applications interact with streams via APIs that are very similar to the well known Reactive Extensions (Rx) in .NET , by using Orleans.Streams.IAsyncStream<T> that implements Orleans.Streams.IAsyncObserver<T> and Orleans.Streams.IAsyncObservable<T> interfaces. In a typical example below a device generates some data, which is sent as an HTTP request to the service running in the Cloud. Orleans client running in the front end server receives this HTTP call and publishes the data into a matching device stream: public async Task OnHttpCall(DeviceEvent deviceEvent) { // Post data directly into device's stream. IAsyncStream<DeviceEventData> deviceStream = GetStream<DeviceEventData>(deviceEvent.DeviceId); await chatStream.OnNextAsync(deviceEvent.Data); } In another example below a chat user (implemented as Orleans Grain) joins a chat room, gets a handle to a stream of chat messages generated by all others users in this room and subscribes to it. Notice that the chat user neither does not need to know about the chat room grain itself (there might not be such a grain in our system) nor about other user in that group that produce messages. Needless to say, to produce to the chat stream, users don't need to know who is currently subscribed to the stream. This demonstrates how chat users can be completely decoupled in time and space. public class ChatUser: Grain { public async Task JoinChat(string chatGroupName) { IAsyncStream<string> chatStream = GetStream<string>(chatGroupName); await chatStream.SubscribeAsync((string chatEvent) => Console.Out.Write(chatEvent)); } } Quick Start Sample The Quick Start Sample is a good quick overview of the overall workflow of using streams in the application. After reading it you should read the Streams Programming APIs to get a deeper understanding of the concepts. Streams Programming APIs A Streams Programming APIs provides detailed description of the programming APIs. Stream Providers Streams can come via physical channels of various shapes and forms and can have different semantics. Orleans Streaming is designed to support this diversity via the concept of Stream Providers , which is an extensibility point in the system. Orleans currently has implementation of two stream providers: TCP based Simple Message Stream Provider and Azure Queue based Azure Queue Stream Provider . More details on Steam Providers can be found at Stream Providers . Stream Semantics Stream Subsription Semantics : Orleans Streams guarantee Sequential Consistency for Stream Subsription operations. Specificaly, when consumer subscribes to a stream, once the Task representing the subsription operation was successfuly resolved, the consumer will see all events that were generated after it has subscribed. In addition, Rewindable streams allow to subscribe from an arbitrary point in time in the past by using StreamSequenceToken (more details can be found here ). Individual Stream Events Delivery Guarantees : Individual event delivery guarantees depend on individual stream providers. Some provide only best-effort at-most-once delivery (such as Simple Message Streams), while others provide at-least-once delivery (such as Azure Queue Streams). It is even possible to build a stream provider that will guarantee exactly-once delivery (we don't have such a provider yet, but it is possible to build one with the extensability model ). Events Delivery Order : Event order also depends on a particular stream provider. In SMS streams, the producer explicitelly controls the order of events seen by the consumer by controlling the way it publishes them. Azure Queue streams do not guarantee FIFO order, since the underlaying Azure Queues do not guarantee order in failure cases. Applications can also control their own stream delivery ordering, by using StreamSequenceToken . Streams Implementation The Orleans Streams Implementation provides a high level overview of the internal implementation. Streams Extensibility The Orleans Streams Extensibility describes how to extend streams with new functionality. Code Samples More examples of how to use streaming APIs within a grain can be found here . We plan to create more samples in the future.

Local Development For local development, where there is only one silo running locally on the programmer’s machine, the configuration is already included in the Orleans Dev/Test Host project template of Microsoft Orleans Tools for Visual Studio . The local silo that can be started by running a project created with the Orleans Dev/Test Host template is configured as follows in DevTestServerConfiguration.xml. <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <SeedNode Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"11111\" /> </Globals> <Defaults> <Networking Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"11111\" /> <ProxyingGateway Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"30000\" /> </Defaults> </OrleansConfiguration> To connect to the local silo, the client needs to be configured to localhost and can only connect from the same machine. The Orleans client that can be started by running a project created with the Orleans Dev/Test Host template is configured as follows in DevTestClientConfiguration.xml <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Gateway Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"30000\"/> </ClientConfiguration> Reliable Production Deployment Using Azure For a reliable production deployment using Azure, you need to use the Azure Table option for cluster membership. This configuration is typical of deployments to either on-premise servers or Azure virtual machine instances. The format of the DataConnection string is \"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName= ;AccountKey= \" <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"AzureTable\" DeploymentId=\"<your deployment ID>\" DataConnectionString=\"<<see comment above>>\" /> <Liveness LivenessType =\"AzureTable\" /> </Globals> <Defaults> <Networking Address=\"\" Port=\"11111\" /> <ProxyingGateway Address=\"\" Port=\"30000\" /> </Defaults> </OrleansConfiguration> Clients need to be configured to use Azure Table for discovering the gateways, the addresses of the Orleans servers are not statically known to the clients. <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"AzureTable\" DeploymentId=\"target deployment ID\" DataConnectionString=\"<<see comment above>>\" /> </ClientConfiguration> Reliable Production Deployment Using ZooKeeper For a reliable production deployment using ZooKeeper, you need to use the ZooKeeper option for cluster membership. This configuration is typical of deployments to on-premise servers. The format of the DataConnection string is documented in the ZooKeeper Programmer's Guide . A minimum of 5 ZooKeeper servers is recommended . <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"ZooKeeper\" DeploymentId=\"<your deployment ID>\" DataConnectionString=\"<<see comment above>>\"/> </Globals> <Defaults> <Networking Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"11111\" /> <ProxyingGateway Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"30000\" /> </Defaults> </OrleansConfiguration> Clients need to be configured to use ZooKeeper for discovering the gateways, the addresses of the Orleans servers are not statically known to the clients. ﻿<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"ZooKeeper\" DeploymentId=\"target deployment ID\" DataConnectionString=\"<<see comment above>>\"/> </ClientConfiguration> Unreliable Deployment on a Cluster of Dedicated Servers For testing on a cluster of dedicated servers when reliability isn’t a concern you can leverage MembershipTableGrain and avoid dependency on Azure Table. You just need to designate one of the nodes as a Primary. <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <SeedNode Address=\"<primary node>\" Port=\"11111\" /> <Liveness LivenessType =\"MembershipTableGrain\" /> </Globals> <Defaults> <Networking Address=\" \" Port=\"11111\" /> <ProxyingGateway Address=\" \" Port=\"30000\" /> </Defaults> </OrleansConfiguration> For the client: <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Gateway Address=\"node-1\" Port=\"30000\"/> <Gateway Address=\"node-2\" Port=\"30000\"/> <Gateway Address=\"node-3\" Port=\"30000\"/> </ClientConfiguration> Azure Worker Role Deployment When Orleans is deployed into an Azure Worker role, as opposed to VM instances, most of the server-side configuration is actually done in files other than the OrleansConfiguration, which looks something like this: <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <Liveness LivenessType=\"AzureTable\" /> </Globals> <Defaults> <Tracing DefaultTraceLevel=\"Info\" TraceToConsole=\"true\" TraceToFile=\"{0}-{1}.log\" /> </Defaults> </OrleansConfiguration> Some information is kept in the service configuration file, in which the worker role section looks like this: <Role name=\"OrleansAzureSilos\"> <Instances count=\"2\" /> <ConfigurationSettings> <Setting name=\"DataConnectionString\" value=\"<<see earlier comment>>\" /> <Setting name=\"Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString\" value=\"<<see earlier comment>>\" /> </ConfigurationSettings> </Role> The data connection string and the diagnostics connection string do not have to be the same. Some configuration information is kept in the service definition file. The worker role has to be configured there, too: <WorkerRole name=\"OrleansAzureSilos\" vmsize=\"Large\"> <Imports> <Import moduleName=\"Diagnostics\" /> </Imports> <ConfigurationSettings> <Setting name=\"DataConnectionString\" /> </ConfigurationSettings> <LocalResources> <LocalStorage name=\"LocalStoreDirectory\" cleanOnRoleRecycle=\"false\" /> </LocalResources> <Endpoints> <InternalEndpoint name=\"OrleansSiloEndpoint\" protocol=\"tcp\" port=\"11111\" /> <InternalEndpoint name=\"OrleansProxyEndpoint\" protocol=\"tcp\" port=\"30000\" /> </Endpoints> </WorkerRole> That's it for the worker role hosting the Orleans runtime. However, when deploying to Azure, there is typically a front end of some sort, either a web site or a web service, since making the Orleans ports public is not a good idea. Therefore, the client configuration is configuration of the web or worker role (or web site) that sits in front of Orleans. Assuming that the frontend is a web role, a simple ClientConfiguration file should be used: <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Tracing DefaultTraceLevel=\"Info\" TraceToConsole=\"true\" TraceToFile=\"{0}-{1}.log\" WriteTraces=\"false\"/> </ClientConfiguration> The web role needs the same connection string information as the worker role, in the service configuration file: <Role name=\"WebRole\"> <Instances count=\"2\" /> <ConfigurationSettings> <Setting name=\"DataConnectionString\" value=\"<<see earlier comment>>\" /> <Setting name=\"Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString\" value=\"<<see earlier comment>>\" /> </ConfigurationSettings> </Role> and in the service definition file: <WebRole name=\"WebRole\" vmsize=\"Large\"> <Imports> <Import moduleName=\"Diagnostics\" /> </Imports> <ConfigurationSettings> <Setting name=\"DataConnectionString\" /> </ConfigurationSettings> <!-- There is additional web role data that has nothing to do with Orleans --> </WebRole>"

    "title": "Server Configuration | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc There are two key aspects of silo configuration: Connectivity: silo’s endpoints for other silos and clients Cluster membership and reliability: how silos discover each other in a deployment and detect node failures. Depending on the environment you want to run Orleans in some of these parameters may or may not be important. For example, for a single silo development environment one usually doesn’t need reliability, and all the endpoints can be localhost. Or if you only use self-managed grains in your application, you don’t need to configure grain index. The following sections detail the configuration setting for the four mentioned key aspects. Then in the scenarios section you can find the recommended combinations of the settings for the most typical deployment scenarios. Connectivity The connectivity settings define two TCP/IP endpoints: one for inter-silo communication and one for client connections, also referred to as client gateway or simply gateway. Inter-silo Endpoint <Networking Address=\" \" Port=\"11111\" /> Address: IP address or host name to use. If left empty, silo will pick the first available IPv4 address. Orleans supports IPv6 as well as IPv4. Port: TCP port to use. If left empty, silo will pick a random available port. If there is only one silo running on the machine, it is advisable to specify a port for consistency and for easy configuration of the firewall. For running multiple silos on the same machine, you can either provide each of the silos with different configuration files or leave the Port attribute empty for a random port assignment. For machines that have more than one IP address assigned to them, if you need to choose an address from a specific subnet or an IPv6 address, you can do that by adding a Subnet and PreferredFamily attributes respectively (refer to the XSD schema for exact syntax of those attributes). For local development environment, you can simply use localhost as the host name: <Networking Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"11111\" /> Client Gateway Endpoint The setting for client gateway endpoint is identical to the inter-silo endpoint except for the XML element name: <ProxyingGateway Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"30000\" /> You have to specify a port number different from the one used for the inter-silo endpoint. It is possible to configure clients to connect to the inter-silo endpoint instead of the gateway, but that requires opening a listening socket on the client (thus requires enabling incoming connections on the client machine firewall), and in general is not advisable other than for a very limited set of scenarios. Cluster Membership and Reliability Usually, a service built on Orleans is deployed on a cluster of nodes, either on dedicated hardware or in Azure. For development and basic testing, Orleans can be deployed in a single node configuration. When deployed to a cluster of nodes, Orleans internally implements a set of protocols to discover and maintain membership of Orleans silos in the cluster, including detection of node failures and automatic reconfiguration. For reliable management of cluster membership, Orleans uses Azure Table, SQL Server or Apache ZooKeeper for synchronization of nodes. The reliable membership setup requires configuring the 'SystemStore' element settings in the silo configuration file: <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"AzureTable\" DeploymentId=\"...\" DataConnectionString=\"...\"/> or <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"SqlServer\" DeploymentId=\"...\" DataConnectionString=\"...\"/> or <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"ZooKeeper\" DeploymentId=\"...\" DataConnectionString=\"...\"/> DeploymentId is a unique string that defines a particular deployment. When deploying an Orleans based service to Azure it makes most sense to use the Azure deployment ID of the worker role. For development or if it’s not possible to use Azure Table, silos can be configured to use the membership grain instead. Such a configuration is unreliable as it will not survive a failure of the primary silo that hosts the membership grain. “MembershipTableGrain” is the default value of LivenessType. <Liveness LivenessType =\"MembershipTableGrain\" /> Primary Silo In a reliable deployment, one that is configured with membership using Azure Table, SQL Server or ZooKeeper, all silos are created equal, with no notion of primary or secondary silos. That is the configuration that is recommended for production that will survive a failure of any individual node or a combination of nodes. For example, Azure periodically rolls out OS patches and that causes all of the role instances to reboot eventually. For development or a non-reliable deployment when MembershipTableGrain is used, one of the silos has to be designated as Primary and has to start and initialize before other, Secondary, silos that wait for Primary to initialize before joining the cluster. In case of a failure of the Primary node, the whole deployment stops working properly and has to be restarted. Primary is designated in the configuration file with the following setting within the Globals section. <SeedNode Address=\"<host name or IP address of the primary node>\" Port=\"11111\" /> Here is an example how to configure and launch Orleans silo hosted inside worker-role. This is a reference only example and SHOULD NOT be used AS-IS - you may need to fine-tune client parameters for your specific environment. var dataConnection = \"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=MYACCOUNTNAME;AccountKey=MYACCOUNTKEY\"; var config = new ClusterConfiguration { Globals = { DeploymentId = RoleEnvironment.DeploymentId, ResponseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30), DataConnectionString = dataConnection, LivenessType = GlobalConfiguration.LivenessProviderType.AzureTable, ReminderServiceType = GlobalConfiguration.ReminderServiceProviderType.AzureTable, }, Defaults = { PropagateActivityId = true, // Tracing DefaultTraceLevel = Severity.Info, TraceToConsole = false, TraceFilePattern = @\"Silo_{0}-{1}.log\", //TraceFilePattern = \"false\", // Set it to false or none to disable file tracing, effectively it sets config.Defaults.TraceFileName = null; TraceLevelOverrides = { Tuple.Create(\"ComponentName\", Severity.Warning), } } }; // Register bootstrap provider class config.Globals.RegisterBootstrapProvider<AutoStartBootstrapProvider>(\"MyAutoStartBootstrapProvider\"); // Add Storage Providers config.Globals.RegisterStorageProvider<MemoryStorage>(\"MemoryStore\"); config.Globals.RegisterStorageProvider<AzureTableStorage>(\"PubSubStore\", new Dictionary<string, string> { { \"DeleteStateOnClear\", \"true\" }, //{ \"UseJsonFormat\", \"true\" }, { \"DataConnectionString\", dataConnection } }); config.Globals.RegisterStorageProvider<AzureTableStorage>(\"AzureTable\", new Dictionary<string, string> { { \"DeleteStateOnClear\", \"true\" }, { \"DataConnectionString\", dataConnection } }); config.Globals.RegisterStorageProvider<AzureTableStorage>(\"DataStorage\", new Dictionary<string, string> { { \"DeleteStateOnClear\", \"true\" }, { \"DataConnectionString\", dataConnection } }); config.Globals.RegisterStorageProvider<BlobStorageProvider>(\"BlobStorage\", new Dictionary<string, string> { { \"DeleteStateOnClear\", \"true\" }, { \"ContainerName\", \"grainstate\" }, { \"DataConnectionString\", dataConnection } }); // Add Stream Providers config.Globals.RegisterStreamProvider<AzureQueueStreamProvider>(\"AzureQueueStreams\", new Dictionary<string, string> { { \"PubSubType\", \"ExplicitGrainBasedAndImplicit\" }, { \"DeploymentId\", \"orleans-streams\" }, { \"NumQueues\", \"4\" }, { \"GetQueueMessagesTimerPeriod\", \"100ms\" }, { \"DataConnectionString\", dataConnection } }); try { _orleansAzureSilo = new AzureSilo(); var ok = _orleansAzureSilo.Start(config, config.Globals.DeploymentId, config.Globals.DataConnectionString); _orleansAzureSilo.Run(); // Call will block until silo is shutdown } catch (Exception exc) { //Log \"Error when starting Silo\" }"

There are also other configuration parameters that primarily help fine tune Orleans for better performance. They are documented in the XSD schema and in general are not required even for running the system in production. Orleans is a framework for building and running high scale services. A typical deployment of an Orleans application spans a cluster of servers. The instances of the Orleans runtime, called silos, running on each of the servers need to be configured to connect to each other. In addition to that, there is always a client component that connects to the Orleans deployment, most typically a web frontend, that needs to be configured to connect to the silos. The Server Configuration and Client Configuration sections of the guide cover those aspects, respectively. The section on Typical Configurations provides a summary of a few common configurations.

    "title": "Client Configuration | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc The key parameter that has to be configured for a client is the silo’s client gateway endpoint(s) to connect to. There are two ways to do that: manually configure one or more gateway endpoints or point the client to the Azure Table used by silos’ cluster membership. In the latter case the client automatically discovers what silos with client gateways enabled are available within the deployment, and adjusts its connections to the gateways as they join or leave the cluster. This option is reliable and recommended for production deployment. Fixed Gateway Configuration A fixed set of gateways is specified in the ClientConfiguration.xml with one or more Gateway nodes: <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Gateway Address=\"gateway1\" Port=\"30000\"/> <Gateway Address=\"gateway2\" Port=\"30000\"/> <Gateway Address=\"gateway3\" Port=\"30000\"/> </ClientConfiguration> One gateway is generally enough. Multiple gateway connections help increase throughput and reliability of the system. Gateway Configuration Based on Cluster Membership To configure the client to automatically find gateways from the silo cluster membership table, you need to specify the Azure Table or SQL Server connection string and the target deployment ID. <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"AzureTable\" DeploymentId=\"target deployment ID\" DataConnectionString=\"Azure storage connection string\"/> </ClientConfiguration> or <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"SqlServer\" DeploymentId=\"target deployment ID\" DataConnectionString=\"SQL connection string\"/> </ClientConfiguration> or <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"ZooKeeper\" DeploymentId=\"target deployment ID\" DataConnectionString=\"ZooKeeper connection string\"/> </ClientConfiguration> Local Silo For the local development/test configuration that uses a local silo, the client gateway should be configured to 'localhost.' <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Gateway Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"30000\"/> </ClientConfiguration> Web Role Client in Azure When the client is a web role running inside the same Azure deployment as the silo worker roles, all gateway address information is read from the OrleansSiloInstances table when OrleansAzureClient.Initialize() is called. The Azure storage connection string used to find the correct OrleansSiloInstances table is specified in the \"DataConnectionString\" setting defined in the service configuration for the deployment & role. <ServiceConfiguration ...> <Role name=\"WebRole\"> ... <ConfigurationSettings> <Setting name=\"DataConnectionString\" value=\"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=MYACCOUNTNAME;AccountKey=MYACCOUNTKEY\" /> </ConfigurationSettings> </Role> ... </ServiceConfiguration> Both the silo worker roles and web client roles need to be use the same Azure storage account in order to successfully discover each other successfully. When using OrleansAzureClient.Initialize() and OrleansSiloInstances table for gateway address discovery, no additional gateway address info in required in the client config file. Typically the ClientConfiguration.xml file will only contain some minimal debug / tracing configuration settings, although even that is not required. <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Tracing DefaultTraceLevel=\"Info\" > <TraceLevelOverride LogPrefix=\"Application\" TraceLevel=\"Info\" /> </Tracing> </ClientConfiguration> Code-based client configuration.

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc TL;DR: You don’t need hundreds of servers to benefit from Orleans. A handful is enough. As we just announced availability of the Project Orleans as a public preview ( Available Now: Preview of Project “Orleans” – Cloud Services at Scale ), some of the initial questions and discussions at //build/ were around what type of services the Orleans programming model is suitable for. I heard statements that Orleans is for super-high scale systems. While technically correct, they felt incomplete to me, and compelled me to write this post. Applicability Spectrum One extreme of the Orleans applicability spectrum is a single machine application. Some people see isolation of actors and safe concurrency as big enough benefits that they are worth the price of message passing. That’s not the use case we optimized for while building Orleans, but it’s a legitimate usage pattern, just not very interesting in the cloud context. At the other end of the spectrum we find massive deployments that span thousands of servers. We tested Orleans on deployments of hundreds of servers, and I’m sure it will run fine on thousands, even if that will require some configuration tweaks. However, I’m personally rather skeptical about how many products actually need a single cloud service spanning thousands of servers as opposed to running multiple related services interacting with each other where each service instance is deployed on tens or hundreds of servers. Distributed system – same problems regardless of the size The moment a system moves from a single server to multiple servers, developers face very much the same set of challenges, regardless of its size -- whether it's a 3-5, 30-50 or 300-500 server system. They now have to deal with distribution of their computations, coordination between them, scalability, fault tolerance and reconfigurations, diagnostics, etc. They are building a distributed system now, which is never easy. And building a stateful distributed system is even harder. Orleans was designed to help with building such systems by providing an easy to use set of abstractions that greatly simplifies developers’ lives and helps them avoid common distributed systems pitfalls. The distributed runtime was built to perform most of the heavy lifting. Developers can equally benefit from these features of Orleans when building services of different sizes because the problems Orleans solves for them are really the same. The abstraction of grains simplifies reasoning about your system while encouraging fine-grain partitioning of state for scalability. The virtual actor feature helps with resource management and fault tolerance. Automatic propagation of exceptions minimizes error handling code without losing failures. The distributed runtime takes care of server failures, messaging, routing, single-threaded execution, and other system level guarantees. You don’t need hundreds of servers to start reaping the developer productivity gains. Elasticity Predicting load for your future system is hard and often simply impossible. Every startup dreams of getting slashdotted one day, which is a blessing for the business and a curse for the system. Or your CMO may like your BI data so much that she suddenly wants to have it in 5 second aggregates instead of 30 minutes. Building for high load that may never materialize is expensive. The Orleans model helps solve the elasticity problem by encouraging designing your system in a scalable way, so that you can start with a small deployment and stay small or scale out big if needed without changing your application code. Bottom Line You should be able to benefit from Orleans the moment you go from a single-server setup to a distributed system, whether it’s 2 or 3 servers or thousands of them. You can even start building your single-server solution with Orleans if you believe you may need one day scale it out or make fault tolerant. The beauty here is that your code won’t need to change. Just add more servers and your grains will spread across them. -Sergey Bykov"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Now that Orleans is (finally) available as open source, it's important to be clear about the goals and principles that has motivated the design decisions behind Orleans so that new changes either fit within that framework or explicitly and intentionally revise those goals and principles. About the time I joined the Orleans project, we agreed that the goal was to produce a framework that would allow mainstream developers to easily build scalable distributed (cloud) applications. To break this down a bit: The target audience shouldn't exclude programmers who haven't done distributed systems development . We want to enable all developers, whether cloud experts or cloud beginners, to focus on their application logic and features -- which is to say, what actually provides business value -- rather than on generic distributed systems issues. The goal is to allow them to build cloud applications easily . Easily means that they shouldn't have to think about distribution any more than is absolutely required. Easily also means that Orleans should present as familiar a façade to the developer as possible; in a .NET context, that means C# objects and interfaces. Those applications should be \"scalable by default\" . Since our target users aren't necessarily distributed systems experts, we want to provide them a framework that will lead them to build scalable applications without explicitly thinking about it. This means that the framework has to make a lot of decisions for them in order to guarantee an acceptable degree of scalability, even if that means that the scalability isn't optimal for every application. We supplemented this goal with a set of architectural principles: We're focused on the 80% case . There are certainly applications that Orleans isn't appropriate for; that's OK. There are applications that Orleans is a reasonable fit for, but where you can get somewhat better performance by a bunch of hand-tuning that Orleans doesn't allow; that's OK too. The 80% that Orleans fits well and performs well enough on covers a lot of interesting applications, and we'd rather do a great job on 80% than a lousy job on 99%. Scalability is paramount . We'll trade off raw performance if that gets us better scaling. Availability is paramount . A cloud application should be like a utility: always there when you want it. Detect and fix problems , don't assume you can 100% prevent them. At cloud scale, bad things happen often, and even impossible bad things happen, just less often. This has led us to what is often termed \"recovery-oriented computing\", rather than trying to be fault-tolerant; our experience has shown that fault tolerance is fragile and often illusory. Even mathematically proven protocols are no protection against random bit flips in memory or disk controllers that fail while reporting success -- both real examples I've seen in production in my career. The above has led us to certain practices: API-first design : if we don't know how we're going to expose a feature to the developer, then we don't build it. Of course, the best way is for a feature have no developer exposure at all... Make it easy to do the right thing : keep things as simple as possible (but no simpler), don't provide a hammer if a screwdriver is the right tool. As one of our early adopters put it, we try to help our customers \"fall into the pit of success\". If there is a standard pattern that will work well for 80% of the applications out there, then don't worry about enabling every possible alternative. Orleans' embrace of asynchrony is a good example of this. Make it easy for developers to extend the framework without breaking it . Custom serialization and persistence providers are a couple of examples of this. Some sort of custom task scheduling extension would be an anti-example. Follow the principle of least surprise : as much as possible, things should be as familiar, but everything should behave the way it looks. The next post will start applying these principles to the current Orleans design and walk through the motivations for some specific decisions we made. Thanks for reading!

Application metadata may be added on the client; it will flow with Orleans requests to the receiving grain. The feature is implemented by a public static class, RequestContext, in the Orleans namespace. This class exposes two simple methods: void Set(string key, object value) is used to store a value in the request context. The value can be any Serializable type. Object Get(string key) is used to retrieve a value from the current request context. The backing storage for RequestContext is thread-static. When a thread (whether client-side or within Orleans) sends a request, the contents of the sending thread’s RequestContext is included with the Orleans message for the request; when the grain code receives the request, that metadata is accessible from the local RequestContext. If the grain code does not modify the RequestContext, then any grain it makes a request of will receive the same metadata, and so on. Application metadata also is maintained when you schedule a future computation using StartNew or ContinueWith; in both cases, the continuation will execute with the same metadata as the scheduling code had at the moment the computation was scheduled (that is, the system makes a copy of the current metadata and passes that to the continuation, so changes after the call to StartNew or ContinueWith will not be seen by the continuation). Note that application metadata does not flow back with responses; that is, code that runs as a result of a response being received, either within a ContinueWith continuation or after a call to Wait or GetValue, will still run within the current context that was set by the original request. For example, to set a trace ID in the client to a new GUID, one would simply call: RequestContext.Set(\"TraceId\", new Guid()); Within grain code (or other code that runs within Orleans on a scheduler thread), the trace ID of the original client request could be used, for instance, when writing a log: Logger.Info(\"Currently processing external request {0}\", RequestContext.Get(\"TraceId\")); While any serializable object may be sent as application metadata, it’s worth mentioning that large or complex objects may add noticeable overhead to message serialization time. For this reason, the use of simple types (strings, GUIDs, or numeric types) is recommended."

    "title": "Why Orleans Streams? | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc There is already a wide range of technologies that allow to build stream processing systems. Those include systems to durably store stream data (e.g., Event Hubs and Kafka ) and systems to express compute operations over the stream data (e.g., Azure Stream Analytics , Apache Storm , and Apache Spark Streaming ). Those are great systems that allow to build effecient data stream processing pipelines. Limitations of Existing Systems However, those systems are not suitable for fine-grained free-form compute over stream data . The Streaming Compute systems mentioned above all allow to specify a unified data-flow graph of operations that are applied in the same way to all stream items . This is a powerful model when data is uniform and you want to express the same set of transformations, filtering or aggregation operations over this data. But there are other use cases where you need to express fundamentally different operations over different data items. And in some of them as part of this processing you occasionally need to make an external call, such as invoke some arbitrary REST API. The unified data-flow stream processing engines either do not support those scenarios, support them in a very limited and constrained way, or are very inefficient in supporting those. This is because they are inherently optimized for large volume of similar items with similar, and usually limited in terms of expressiveness, processing . Orleans Streams target those other scenarios. Motivation It all started with requests from Orleans users to support returning a sequence of items from a grain method call. As you can imagine, that was only the tip of the iceberg. They actually needed much more than that. A typical scenario for Orleans Streams is when you have per user streams and you want to perform different processing for each user , within the context of an individual user. We may have millions of users but some of them are interested in weather and can subscribe to weather alerts for a particular location, while some are interested in sports events; somebody is tracking status of a particular flight. Processing those events requires different logic, but you don't want to run two independent instances of stream processing. Some users are interested in only a particular stock and only if certain external condition applies, condition that may not necessarily be part of the stream data (thus needs to be checked dynamically at runtime as part of processing). Users change their interests all the time, hence their subscriptions to specific streams of events come and go dynamically, thus the streaming topology changes dynamically and rapidly . On top of that, the processing logic per user evolves and changes dynamically as well, based on user state and external events . External events may modify the processing logic for a particular user. For example, in a game cheating detection system, when a new way to cheat is discovered the processing logic needs to be updated with the new rule to detect this new violation. This needs to be done of course without disrupting the ongoing processing pipeline . Bulk data-flow stream processing engines were not build to support such scenarios. It goes almost without saying that such a system has to run on a number of network-connected machines, not on a signle node. Hence, the processing logic has to be distributed in a scalable and elastic manner across a cluster of servers. New Requirements We identified 4 basic requirements for our Stream Processing system that will allow it to target the above scenarios. Flexible stream processing logic Support for highly dynamic topologies Fine-grained stream granularity Distribution Flexible stream processing logic We want the system to support different ways of expressing the stream processing logic. The existing systems we mentioned above require the developer to write a declarative data-flow computation graph, usually by following a functional programming style. This limits the expressiveness and flexibility of the processing logic. Orleans streams are indifferent to the way processing logic is expressed. It can be expressed as a data-flow (e.g., by using Reactive Extensions (Rx) in .NET ); as a functional program; as a declarative query; or in a general imperative logic. The logic can be stateful or stateless, may or may not have side effects, and can trigger external actions. All power goes to the developer. Support for dynamic topologies We want the system to allow for dynamically evolving topologies. The existing systems we mentioned above are usually limited to only static topologies that are fixed at deployment time and cannot evolve at runtime. In the following example of a dataflow expression everything is nice and simple until you need to change it. Stream.GroupBy(x=> x.key).Extract(x=>x.field).Select(x=>x+2).AverageWindow(x, 5sec).Where(x=>x > 0.8) * Change the threshold condition in the Where filter, add an additional Select statement or add another branch in the data-flow graph and produce a new output stream. In existing systems this is not possible without tearing down the entire topology and restarting the data-flow from scratch. Practically, those systems will checkpoint the existing computation and will be able to restart from the latest checkpoint. Still, such a restart is disruptive and costly to an online service that produces results in real time. Such a restart becomes especially impractical when we are talking about a large number of such expressions being executed with similar but different (per-user, per-deveice, et.) parameters and that keep constantly changing. We want the system to allow for evolving the stream processing graph at runtime, by adding new links or nodes to the computation graph, or by changing the processing logic within the computation nodes. Fine grained stream granularity In the existing systems, the smallest unit of abstraction is usually the whole flow (topology). However, many of our target scenarios require individual node/link in the topology to be a logical entity by itself. That way each entity can be potentially managed independently. For example, in the big stream topology comprising of multiple links, different links can have different characteristics and can be implemented over different physical transports. Some links can go over TCP sockets, while others over reliable queues. Different links can have different delivery guarantees. Different nodes can have different checkpointing strategies, and their processing logic can be expressed in different models or even different languages. Such flexibility is usually not possible in existing systems. The unit of abstraction and flexibility argument is similar to comparison of SoA (Service Oriented Architectures) vs. Actors. Actor systems allow more flexibility, since each is essentially an independently managed ''tiny service''. Similarly, we want the system to allow for such a fine grained control. Distribution And of course, our system should have all the properties of a \"good distributed system\" . That includes: Scalability - supports large number of streams and compute elements. Elasticity - allows to add/remove resources to grow/shrink based on load. Reliability - be resilient to failures Efficiency - use the underlying resources efficiently Responsiveness - enable near real time scenarios. These were the requirements we had in mind for building Orleans Streaming . Clarificaton : Orleans currently does not directly support writing declarative dataflow expressions like in the example above. The current Orleans Streaming APIs are more low level building blocks, as described here . Providing declarative dataflow expressions is our future goal. Next Orleans Streams Programming APIs"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Configuring Connections to Orleans To allow applications to communicate with grains from outside Orleans, the framework includes a client library. This client library might be used by a desktop or mobile application, or by a front end server that renders interactive web pages or exposes a web services API. The client library provides an API for writing asynchronous clients that communicate with Orleans grains. Once the client library is connected to an Orleans gateway, a client can send messages to grains, receive responses and receive asynchronous notifications from grains via observers. Connecting to a Gateway To establish a connection, a client calls GrainClient.Initialize() . This will connect to the gateway silo at the IP address and port specified in the ClientConfiguration.xml file. This file must be placed in the same directory as the Orleans.dll library used by the client. As an alternative, a configuration object can be passed to GrainClient.Initialize() programmatically instead of loading it from a file. Configuring the Client In ClientConfiguration.xml , the Gateway element specifies the address and port of the gateway endpoint that need to match those in OrleansConfiguration.xml on the silo side: <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Gateway Address=\"<IP address or host name of silo>\" Port=\"30000\" /> </ClientConfiguration> If an Orleans-based application runs in Windows Azure, the client automatically discovers silo gateways and shouldn't be statically configured. Refer to the Azure application sample for an example of how to configure the client. Configuring Silos In OrleansConfiguration.xml , the ProxyingGateway element specifies the gateway endpoint of the silo, which is separate from the inter-silo endpoint defined by the Networking element and must have a different port number: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Defaults> <Networking Address=\"\" Port=\"11111\" /> <ProxyingGateway Address=\"\" Port=\"30000\" /> </Defaults> </OrleansConfiguration>"

    "title": "Client Observers | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc There are situations in which a simple message/response pattern is not enough, and the client needs to receive asynchronous notifications. For example, a user might want to be notified when a new instant message has been published by a friend. Client observers is a mechanism that allows notifying clients asynchronously. An observer is a one-way asynchronous interface that inherits from IGrainObserver , and all its methods must be void. The grain sends a notification to the observer by invoking it like a grain interface method, except that it has no return value, and so the grain need not depend on the result. The Orleans runtime will ensure one-way delivery of the notifications. A grain that publishes such notifications should provide an API to add or remove observers. In addition, it is usually convenient to expose a method that allows an existing subscription to be cancelled. Grain developers may use the Orleans ObserverSubscriptionManager<T> generic class to simplify development of observed grain types. To subscribe to a notification, the client must first create a local C# object that implements the observer interface. It then calls a static method on the observer factory, CreateObjectReference() , to turn the C# object into a grain reference, which can then be passed to the subscription method on the notifying grain. This model can also be used by other grains to receive asynchronous notifications. Unlike in the client subscription case, the subscribing grain simply implements the observer interface as a facet, and passes in a reference to itself (e.g. this.AsReference<IMyGrainObserverInterface> ). Code Example Let's assume that we have a grain that periodicaly sends messages to clients. For simplicity, the message in our example will be a string. We first define the interface on the client that will receive the message. the interface will look like this public interface IChat : IGrainObserver { void ReceiveMessage(string message); } The only special thing is that the interface should inherit from IGrainObserver . Now any client that wants to observe those messages should implement a class which implements IChat . The simplest case would be something like this: public class Chat : IChat { public void ReceiveMessage(string message) { Console.WriteLine(message); } } Now on the server we should have a Grain which sends these chat messages to clients. The Grain also should have a mechanism for clients to subscribe and unsubscribe themselves to receive notifications. For subscription the Grain can use the utility class ObserverSubscriptionManager : class HelloGrain : Grain, IHello { private ObserverSubscriptionManager<IChat> _subsManager; public override async Task OnActivateAsync() { // We created the utility at activation time. _subsManager = new ObserverSubscriptionManager<IChat>(); await base.OnActivateAsync(); } // Clients call this to subscribe. public async Task Subscribe(IChat observer) { _subsManager.Subscribe(observer); } //Also clients use this to unsubscribe themselves to no longer receive the messages. public async Task UnSubscribe(IChat observer) { _SubsManager.Unsubscribe(observer); } } To send the message to clients the Notify method of the ObserverSubscriptionManager<IChat> instance can be used. The method takes an Action<T> method or lambda expression (where T is of type IChat here). You can call any method on the interface to send it to clients. In our case we only have one method ReceiveMessage and our sending code on the server would look like this: public Task SendUpdateMessage(string message) { _SubsManager.Notify(s => s.ReceiveMessage(message)); return TaskDone.Done; } Now our server has a method to send messages to observer clients, two methods for subscribing/unsubscribing and the client implemented a class to be able to observe the grain messages. The last step is to create an observer reference on the client using our previously implemented Chat class and let it receive the messages after subscribing it. The code would look like this: //First create the grain reference var friend = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IHello>(0); Chat c = new Chat(); //Create a reference for chat usable for subscribing to the observable grain. var obj = await GrainClient.GrainFactory.CreateObjectReference<IChat>(c); //Subscribe the instance to receive messages. await friend.Subscribe(obj); Now whenever our grain on the server calls the SendUpdateMessage method, all subscribed clients will receive the message. In our client code, the Chat instance in variable c will receive the message and output it to the console. Note: Support for observers might be removed in a future version and replaced with a Simple Message Stream SMS , which can support the same concept with more power, flexibility, and reliability. Next Next we look at Developing a Grain"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Grains (Actors): Units of Distribution Distributed applications are inherently concurrent, which leads to complexity. One of the things that makes the actor model special and productive is that it helps reduce some of the complexities of having to grapple with concurrency. Actors accomplish this in two ways: By providing single-threaded access to the internal state of an actor instance. By not sharing data between actor instances except via message-passing. Grains are the building blocks of an Orleans application, they are atomic units of isolation, distribution, and persistence. A typical grain encapsulates state and behavior of a single entity (e.g. a specific user). Turns: Units of Execution The idea behind the single-threaded execution model for actors is that the invokers (remote) take turns \"calling\" its methods. Thus, a message coming to actor B from actor A will placed in a queue and the associated handler is invoked only when all prior messages have been serviced. This allows us to avoid all use of locks to protect actor state, as it is inherently protected against data races. However, it may also lead to problems when messages pass back and forth and the message graph forms cycles. If A sends a message to B from one of its methods and awaits its completion, and B sends a message to A, also awaiting its completion, the application will quickly lock up. A Grain Activation - The runtime instance of a Grain When there is work for a grain, Orleans ensures there is an instance of the grain on one of Orleans Silos . When there is no instance of the grain on any silo, the run-time creates one. This process is called Activation. In case a grain is using Grain Persistence , the run-time automatically reads the state from the backing-store upon activation. Orleans controls the process of activating and deactivating grains transparently. When coding a grain, a developer assumes all grains are always activated. A grain activation performs work in chunks and finishes each chunk before it moves on to the next. Chunks of work include method invocations in response to requests from other grains or external clients, and closures scheduled on completion of a previous chunk. The basic unit of execution corresponding to a chunk of work is known as a turn. While Orleans may execute many turns belonging to different activations in parallel, each activation will always execute its turns one at a time. This means that there is no need to use locks or other synchronization methods to guard against data races and other multi-threading hazards. As mentioned above, however, the unpredictable interleaving of turns for scheduled closures can cause the state of the grain to be different than when the closure was scheduled, so developers must still watch out for interleaving bugs. Activation modes Orleans supports two modes: single activation mode (default), in which only one simultaneous activation of every grain is created, and stateless worker mode, in which independent activations of a grain are created to increase the throughput. \"Independent\" implies that there is no state reconciliation between different activations of the same grain. So this mode is appropriate for grains that hold no local state, or grains whose local state is static, such as a grain that acts as a cache of persistent state Next Next we look at Silos, a unit for hosting grains.

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Grain Persistence Goals Allow different grain types to use different types of storage providers (e.g., one uses Azure table, and one uses SQL Azure) or the same type of storage provider but with different configurations (e.g., both use Azure table, but one uses storage account #1 and one uses storage account #2) Allow configuration of a storage provider instance to be swapped (e.g., Dev-Test-Prod) with just config file changes, and no code changes required. Provide a framework to allow additional storage providers to be written later, either by the Orleans team or others. Provide a minimal set of production-grade storage providers Storage providers have complete control over how they store grain state data in persistent backing store. Corollary: Orleans is not providing a comprehensive ORM storage solution, but allows custom storage providers to support specific ORM requirements as and when required. Grain Persistence API Grain types can be declared in one of two ways: Extend Grain if they do not have any persistent state, or if they will handle all persistent state themselves, or Extend Grain<T> if they have some persistent state that they want the Orleans runtime to handle. Stated another way, by extending Grain<T> a grain type is automatically opted-in to the Orleans system managed persistence framework. For the remainder of this section, we will only be considering Option #2 / Grain<T> because Option #1 grains will continue to run as now without any behavior changes. Grain State Stores Grain classes that inherit from Grain<T> (where T is an application-specific state data type derived from GrainState ) will have their state loaded automatically from a specified storage. Grains will be marked with a [StorageProvider] attribute that specifies a named instance of a storage provider to use for reading / writing the state data for this grain. [StorageProvider(ProviderName=\"store1\")] public class MyGrain<MyGrainState> ... { ... } The Orleans Provider Manager framework provides a mechanism to specify & register different storage providers and storage options in the silo config file. <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <StorageProviders> <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.MemoryStorage\" Name=\"DevStore\" /> <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.AzureTableStorage\" Name=\"store1\" DataConnectionString=\"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=data1;AccountKey=SOMETHING1\" /> <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.AzureBlobStorage\" Name=\"store2\" DataConnectionString=\"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=data2;AccountKey=SOMETHING2\" /> </StorageProviders> Configuring Storage Providers AzureTableStorage <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.AzureTableStorage\" Name=\"TableStore\" DataConnectionString=\"UseDevelopmentStorage=true\" /> The following attributes can be added to the <Provider /> element to configure the provider: DataConnectionString=\"...\" (mandatory) - The Azure storage connection string to use TableName=\"OrleansGrainState\" (optional) - The table name to use in table storage, defaults to OrleansGrainState DeleteStateOnClear=\"false\" (optional) - If true, the record will be deleted when grain state is cleared, otherwise an null record will be written, defaults to false UseJsonFormat=\"false\" (optional) - If true, the json serializer will be used, otherwise the Orleans binary serializer will be used, defaults to false UseFullAssemblyNames=\"false\" (optional) - (if UseJsonFormat=\"true\" ) Serializes types with full assembly names (true) or simple (false), defaults to false IndentJSON=\"false\" (optional) - (if UseJsonFormat=\"true\" ) Indents the serialized json, defaults to false Note: state should not exceed 64KB, a limit imposed by Table Storage. AzureBlobStorage <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.AzureTableStorage\" Name=\"BlobStore\" DataConnectionString=\"UseDevelopmentStorage=true\" /> The following attributes can be added to the <Provider /> element to configure the provider: DataConnectionString=\"...\" (mandatory) - The Azure storage connection string to use ContainerName=\"grainstate\" (optional) - The blob storage container to use, defaults to grainstate UseFullAssemblyNames=\"false\" (optional) - Serializes types with full assembly names (true) or simple (false), defaults to false IndentJSON=\"false\" (optional) - Indents the serialized json, defaults to false <!-- ### SqlStorageProvider ```xml <Provider Type=\"Orleans.SqlUtils.StorageProvider.SqlStorageProvider\" Name=\"SqlStore\" ConnectionString=\"...\" /> ``` * __`ConnectionString=\"...\"`__ (mandatory) - The SQL connection string to use * __`MapName=\"\"`__ ??? * __`ShardCredentials=\"\"`__ ??? * __`StateMapFactoryType=\"\"`__ (optional) defaults to `Lazy`??? * __`Ignore=\"false\"`__ (optional) - If true, disables persistence, defaults to `false` --> MemoryStorage <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.MemoryStorage\" Name=\"MemoryStorage\" /> Note: This provider persists state to volatile memory which is erased at silo shut down. Use only for testing. NumStorageGrains=\"10\" (optional) - The number of grains to use to store the state, defaults to 10 ShardedStorageProvider <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.ShardedStorageProvider\" Name=\"ShardedStorage\"> <Provider /> <Provider /> <Provider /> </Provider> Simple storage provider for writing grain state data shared across a number of other storage providers. A consistent hash function (default is Jenkins Hash) is used to decide which shard (in the order they are defined in the config file) is responsible for storing state data for a specified grain, then the Read / Write / Clear request is bridged over to the appropriate underlying provider for execution. Notes on Storage Providers If there is no [StorageProvider] attribute specified for a Grain<T> grain class, then a provider named Default will be searched for instead. If not found then this is treated as a missing storage provider. If there is only one provider in the silo config file, it will be considered to be the Default provider for this silo. A grain that uses a storage provider which is not present and defined in the silo configuration when the silo loads will fail to load, but the rest of the grains in that silo can still load and run. Any later calls to that grain type will fail with an Orleans.Storage.BadProviderConfigException error specifying that the grain type is not loaded. The storage provider instance to use for a given grain type is determined by the combination of the storage provider name defined in the [StorageProvider] attribute on that grain type, plus the provider type and configuration options for that provider defined in the silo config. Different grain types can use different configured storage providers, even if both are the same type: for example, two different Azure table storage provider instances, connected to different Azure storage accounts (see config file example above). All configuration details for storage providers is defined statically in the silo configuration that is read at silo startup. There are no mechanisms provided at this time to dynamically update or change the list of storage providers used by a silo. However, this is a prioritization / workload constraint rather than a fundamental design constraint. State Storage APIs There are two main parts to the grain state / persistence APIs: Grain-to-Runtime and Runtime-to-Storage-Provider. Grain State Storage API The grain state storage functionality in the Orleans Runtime will provide read and write operations to automatically populate / save the GrainState data object for that grain. Under the covers, these functions will be connected (within the code generated by Orleans client-gen tool) through to the appropriate persistence provider configured for that grain. Grain State Read / Write Functions Grain state will automatically be read when the grain is activated, but grains are responsible for explicitly triggering the write for any changed grain state as and when necessary. See the Failure Modes section below for details of error handling mechanisms. GrainState will be read automatically (using the equivalent of base.ReadStateAsync() ) before the OnActivateAsync() method is called for that activation. GrainState will not be refreshed before any method calls to that grain, unless the grain was activated for this call. During any grain method call, a grain can request the Orleans runtime to write the current grain state data for that activation to the designated storage provider by calling base.WriteStateAsync() . The grain is responsible for explicitly performing write operations when they make significant updates to their state data. Most commonly, the grain method will return the base.WriteStateAsync() Task as the final result Task returned from that grain method, but it is not required to follow this pattern. The runtime will not automatically update stored grain state after any grain methods. During any grain method or timer callback handler in the grain, the grain can request the Orleans runtime to re-read the current grain state data for that activation from the designated storage provider by calling base.ReadStateAsync() . This will completely overwrite any current state data currently stored in the grain state object with the latest values read from persistent store. An opaque provider-specific Etag value ( string ) may be set by a storage provider as part of the grain state metadata populated when state was read. Some providers may choose to leave this as null if they do not use Etag s. Conceptually, the Orleans Runtime will take a deep copy of the grain state data object for its own use during any write operations. Under the covers, the runtime may use optimization rules and heuristics to avoid performing some or all of the deep copy in some circumstances, provided that the expected logical isolation semantics are preserved. Sample Code for Grain State Read / Write Operations Grains must extend the Grain<T> class in order to participate in the Orleans grain state persistence mechanisms. The T in the above definition will be replaced by an application-specific grain state class for this grain; see the example below. The grain class should also be annotated with a [StorageProvider] attribute that tells the runtime which storage provider (instance) to use with grains of this type. public interface MyGrainState : GrainState { public int Field1 { get; set; } public string Field2 { get; set; } } [StorageProvider(ProviderName=\"store1\")] public class MyPersistenceGrain : Grain<MyGrainState>, IMyPersistenceGrain { ... } Grain State Read The initial read of the grain state will occur automatically by the Orleans runtime before the grain’s OnActivateAsync() method is called; no application code is required to make this happen. From that point forward, the grain’s state will be available through the Grain<T>.State property inside the grain class. Grain State Write After making any appropriate changes to the grain’s in-memory state, the grain should call the base.WriteStateAsync() method to write the changes to the persistent store via the defined storage provider for this grain type. This method is asynchronous and returns a Task that will typically be returned by the grain method as its own completion Task. public Task DoWrite(int val) { State.Field1 = val; return base.WriteStateAsync(); } Grain State Refresh If a grain wishes to explicitly re-read the latest state for this grain from backing store, the grain should call the base.ReadStateAsync() method. This will reload the grain state from persistent store, via the defined storage provider for this grain type, and any previous in-memory copy of the grain state will be overwritten and replaced when the ReadStateAsync() Task completes. public async Task<int> DoRead() { await base.ReadStateAsync(); return State.Field1; } Failure Modes for Grain State Persistence Operations Failure Modes for Grain State Read Operations Failures returned by the storage provider during the initial read of state data for that particular grain will result in the activate operation for that grain to be failed; in this case, there will not be any call to that grain’s OnActivateAsync() life cycle callback method. The original request to that grain which caused the activation will be faulted back to the caller the same way as any other failure during grain activation. Failures encountered by the storage provider to read state data for a particular grain will result in the ReadStateAsync() Task to be faulted. The grain can choose to handle or ignore that faulted Task , just like any other Task in Orleans. Any attempt to send a message to a grain which failed to load at silo startup time due to a missing / bad storage provider config will return the permanent error Orleans.BadProviderConfigException . Failure Modes for Grain State Write Operations Failures encountered by the storage provider to write state data for a particular grain will result in the WriteStateAsync() Task to be faulted. Usually, this will mean the grain call will be faulted back to the client caller provided the WriteStateAsync() Task is correctly chained in to the final return Task for this grain method. However, it will be possible for certain advanced scenarios to write grain code to specifically handle such write errors, just like they can handle any other faulted Task . Grains that execute error-handling / recovery code must catch exceptions / faulted WriteStateAsync() Task s and not re-throw to signify that they have successfully handled the write error. Storage Provider Framework There is a service provider API for writing additional persistence providers – IStorageProvider . The Persistence Provider API covers read and write operations for GrainState data. public interface IStorageProvider { Logger Log { get; } Task Init(); Task Close(); Task ReadStateAsync(string grainType, GrainId grainId, GrainState grainState); Task WriteStateAsync(string grainType, GrainId grainId, GrainState grainState); } Storage Provider Semantics Any attempt to perform a write operation when the storage provider detects an Etag constraint violation should cause the write Task to be faulted with transient error Orleans.InconsistentStateException and wrapping the underlying storage exception. public class InconsistentStateException : AggregateException { /// <summary>The Etag value currently held in persistent storage.</summary> public string StoredEtag { get; private set; } /// <summary>The Etag value currently held in memory, and attempting to be updated.</summary> public string CurrentEtag { get; private set; } public InconsistentStateException( string errorMsg, string storedEtag, string currentEtag, Exception storageException ) : base(errorMsg, storageException) { this.StoredEtag = storedEtag; this.CurrentEtag = currentEtag; } public InconsistentStateException(string storedEtag, string currentEtag, Exception storageException) : this(storageException.Message, storedEtag, currentEtag, storageException) { } } Any other failure conditions from a write operation should cause the write Task to be broken with an exception containing the underlying storage exception. Data Mapping Individual storage providers should decide how best to store grain state – blob (various formats / serialized forms) or column-per-field are obvious choices. The basic storage provider for Azure Table encodes state data fields into a single table column using Orleans binary serialization."

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Please read about Grains before reading this article. Grain Interfaces Grains interact with each other by invoking methods declared as part of the respective grain interfaces. A grain class implements one or more previously declared grain interfaces. All methods of a grain interface must return a Task (for void methods) or a Task<T> (for methods returning values of type T ). The following is an excerpt from the Presence Service sample: //an example of a Grain Interface public interface IPlayerGrain : IGrainWithGuidKey { Task<IGameGrain> GetCurrentGame(); Task JoinGame(IGameGrain game); Task LeaveGame(IGameGrain game); } //an example of a Grain class implementing a Grain Interface public class PlayerGrain : Grain, IPlayerGrain { private IGameGrain currentGame; // Game the player is currently in. May be null. public Task<IGameGrain> GetCurrentGame() { return Task.FromResult(currentGame); } // Game grain calls this method to notify that the player has joined the game. public Task JoinGame(IGameGrain game) { currentGame = game; Console.WriteLine(\"Player {0} joined game {1}\", this.GetPrimaryKey(), game.GetPrimaryKey()); return TaskDone.Done; } // Game grain calls this method to notify that the player has left the game. public Task LeaveGame(IGameGrain game) { currentGame = null; Console.WriteLine(\"Player {0} left game {1}\", this.GetPrimaryKey(), game.GetPrimaryKey()); return TaskDone.Done; } } Grain Reference A Grain Reference is a proxy object that implements the same grain interface implemented by the corresponding grain class. Using asynchronous messaging, it provides full-duplex communication with other grains, as well as Orleans Client code. A grain reference can be constructed by passing the identity of a grain to the GrainFactory.GetGrain<T>() method, where T is the grain interface. Developers can use grain references like any other .NET object. It can be passed to a method, used as a method return value, etc. The following are examples of how to construct a grain reference of the IPlayerGrain interface defined above. In Orleans Client code: //construct the grain reference of a specific player IPlayerGrain player = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IPlayerGrain>(playerId); From inside a Grain class: //construct the grain reference of a specific player IPlayerGrain player = GrainFactory.GetGrain<IPlayerGrain>(playerId); Grain Method Invocation The Orleans programming model is based on Asynchronous Programming with async and await. A detailed article about the subject is here . Using the grain reference from the previous example, the following is an example of grain method invocation: //Invoking a grain method asynchronously Task joinGameTask = player.JoinGame(this); //The `await` keyword effectively turns the remainder of the method into a closure that will asynchronously execute upon completion of the Task being awaited without blocking the executing thread. await joinGameTask; //The next lines will be turned into a closure by the C# compiler. players.Add(playerId); It is possible to join two or more Task s; the join creates a new Task that is resolved when all of its constituent Task s are completed. This is a useful pattern when a grain needs to start multiple computations and wait for all of them to complete before proceeding. For example, a front-end grain that generates a web page made of many parts might make multiple back-end calls, one for each part, and receive a Task for each result. The grain would then wait for the join of all of these Task s; when the join is resolved, the individual Task s have been completed, and all the data required to format the web page has been received. Example: List<Task> tasks = new List<Task>(); ChirperMessage chirp = CreateNewChirpMessage(text); foreach (IChirperSubscriber subscriber in Followers.Values) { tasks.Add(subscriber.NewChirpAsync(chirp)); } Task joinedTask = Task.WhenAll(tasks); await joinedTask; TaskDone.Done Utility Property There is no \"standard\" way to conveniently return an already completed \"void\" Task , so Orleans sample code defines TaskDone.Done for that purpose.

    "title": "Developing a Client | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Once we have our grain type implemented, we can write a client application that uses the type. The following Orleans DLLs from either the [SDK-ROOT]\\Binaries\\PresenceClient_ or _[SDK-ROOT]\\Samples\\References directories need to be referenced in the client application project: Orleans.dll OrleansRuntimeInterfaces.dll Almost any client will involve use of the grain factory class. The GetGrain() method is used for getting a grain reference for a particular ID. As was already mentioned, grains cannot be explicitly created or deleted. GrainClient.Initialize(); // Hardcoded player ID Guid playerId = new Guid(\"{2349992C-860A-4EDA-9590-000000000006}\"); IPlayerGrain player = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IPlayerGrain>(playerId); IGameGrain game = player.CurrentGame.Result; var watcher = new GameObserver(); var observer = GrainClient.GrainFactory.CreateObjectReference<IGameObserver>(watcher); await game.SubscribeForGameUpdates(); If this code is used from the main thread of a console application, you have to call Wait() on the task returned by game.SubscribeForGameUpdates() because await does not prevent the Main() function from returning, which will cause the client process to exit. See the Key Concepts section for more details on the various ways to use Task s for execution scheduling and exception flow. Find or create grains After establishing a connection by calling GrainClient.Initialize() , static methods in the generic factory class may be used to get a reference to a grain, such as GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IPlayerGrain>() for the PlayerGrain . The grain interface is passed as a type argument to GrainFactory.GetGrain<T>() . Sending messages to grains The programming model for communicating with grains from a client is almost the same as from a grain. The client holds grain references which implement a grain interface like IPlayerGrain . It invokes methods on that grain reference, and these return asynchronous values: Task / Task<T> , or another grain interface inheriting from IGrain . The client can use the await keyword or ContinueWith() method to queue continuations to be executed when these asynchronous values resolve, or the Wait() method to block the current thread. The one key difference between communicating with a grain from within a client or from within another grain is the single-threaded execution model. Grains are constrained to be single-threaded by the Orleans scheduler, while clients may be multi-threaded. The client library uses the TPL thread pool to manage continuations and callbacks, and so it is up to the client to manage its own concurrency using whatever synchronization constructs are appropriate for its environment – locks, events, TPL tasks, etc. Receiving notifications There are situations in which a simple message/response pattern is not enough, and the client needs to receive asynchronous notifications. For example, a user might want to be notified when a new message has been published by someone that she is following. An observer is a one-way asynchronous interface that inherits from IGrainObserver , and all its methods must be void . The grain sends a notification to the observer by invoking it like a grain interface method, except that it has no return value, and so the grain need not depend on the result. The Orleans runtime will ensure one-way delivery of the notifications. A grain that publishes such notifications should provide an API to add or remove observers. To subscribe to a notification, the client must first create a local C# object that implements the observer interface. It then calls CreateObjectReference() method on the grain factory, to turn the C# object into a grain reference, which can then be passed to the subscription method on the notifying grain. This model can also be used by other grains to receive asynchronous notifications. Unlike in the client subscription case, the subscribing grain simply implements the observer interface as a facet, and passes in a reference to itself (e.g. this.AsReference<IChirperViewer> ). Example Here is an extended version of the example given above of a client application that connects to Orleans, finds the player account, subscribes for updates to the game session the player is part of, and prints out notifications until the program is manually terminated. namespace PlayerWatcher { class Program { /// <summary> /// Simulates a companion application that connects to the game /// that a particular player is currently part of, and subscribes /// to receive live notifications about its progress. /// </summary> static void Main(string[] args) { try { GrainClient.Initialize(); // Hardcoded player ID Guid playerId = new Guid(\"{2349992C-860A-4EDA-9590-000000000006}\"); IPlayerGrain player = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IPlayerGrain>(playerId); IGameGrain game = null; while (game == null) { Console.WriteLine(\"Getting current game for player {0}...\", playerId); try { game = player.CurrentGame.Result; if (game == null) // Wait until the player joins a game Thread.Sleep(5000); } catch (Exception exc) { Console.WriteLine(\"Exception: \", exc.GetBaseException()); } } Console.WriteLine(\"Subscribing to updates for game {0}...\", game.GetPrimaryKey()); // Subscribe for updates var watcher = new GameObserver(); game.SubscribeForGameUpdates(GrainClient.GrainFactory.CreateObjectReference<IGameObserver>(watcher)).Wait(); // .Wait will block main thread so that the process doesn't exit. // Updates arrive on thread pool threads.

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Orleans has a feature that can be used to avoid some of the overhead associated with serializing request messages. This note starts with a general description of how serialization works, and then explains how to use the new feature. Serialization in Orleans When a grain method is invoked, the Orleans runtime makes a deep copy of the method arguments and forms the request out of the copies. This protects against the calling code modifying the argument objects before the data is passed to the called grain. If the called grain is on a different silo, then the copies are eventually serialized into a byte stream and sent over the network to the target silo, where they are deserialized back into objects. If the called grain is on the same silo, then the copies are handed directly to the called method. Return values are handled the same way: first copied, then possibly serialized and deserialized. Note that all 3 processes, copying, serializing, and deserializing, respect object identity. In other words, if you pass a list that has the same object in it twice, on the receiving side you'll get a list with the same object in it twice, rather than with two objects with the same values in them. Also note that Orleans doesn't use the .NET serializer or the data contract serializer. Orleans uses a mix of hand-crafted code for common system types (collections, primitives, and a few others) and generated code for application types. If a type with neither a hand-crafted or generated serializer is encountered, Orleans will fall back to the .NET serializer, but this should be a rare occurrence. We try to avoid this because the .NET serializer is significantly slower than the Orleans serializer, and creates significantly larger messages. Optimizing Copying In many cases, the deep copying is unnecessary. For instance, a possible scenario is a web front-end that receives a byte array from its client and passes that request, including the byte array, on to a grain for processing. The front-end process doesn't do anything with the array once it has passed it on to the grain; in particular, it doesn't reuse the array to receive a future request. Inside the grain, the byte array is parsed to fetch the input data, but not modified. The grain returns another byte array that it has created to get passed back to the web client; it discards the array as soon as it returns it. The web front-end passes the result byte array back to its client, without modification. In such a scenario, there is no need to copy either the request or response byte arrays. Unfortunately, the Orleans runtime can't figure this out by itself, since it can't tell whether or not the arrays are modified later on by the web front-end or by the grain. In the best of all possible worlds, we'd have some sort of .NET mechanism for indicating that a value is no longer modified; lacking that, we've added an Orleans-specific mechanism for this: the Immutable wrapper class. Immutable The Orleans.Concurrency.Immutable wrapper class is used to indicate that a value may be considered immutable; that is, the underlying value will not be modified, so no copying is required for safe sharing. Note that using Immutable implies that neither the provider of the value nor the recipient of the value will modify it in the future; it is not a one-sided commitment, but rather a mutual dual-side commitment. Using Immutable Using Immutable is simple: in your grain interface, instead of passing T, pass Immutable . For instance, in the above described scenario, the grain method that was: Task<byte[]> ProcessRequest(byte[] request); becomes: Task<Immutable<byte[]>> ProcessRequest(Immutable<byte[]> request); To create an Immutable , simply use the constructor: Immutable<byte[]> immutable = new Immutable<byte[]>(buffer); And to get the value inside the immutable, use the .Value property: byte[] buffer = immutable.Value; You can also get a deep copy of the value inside the Immutable, in case you need a value that can be modified, using the GetCopy method: byte[] buffer = immutable.GetCopy(); What Is Immutable? For the purposes of the Immutable<> class, immutability is a rather strict statement: the contents of the data item will not be modified in any way that could change the item's semantic meaning, or that would interfere with another thread simultaneously accessing the item. The safest way to ensure this is to simply not modify the item at all: bitwise immutability, rather than logical immutability. In some cases it is safe to relax this to logical immutability, but care must be taken to ensure that the mutating code is properly thread-safe; because dealing with multithreading is complex, and uncommon in an Orleans context, we strongly recommend against this approach and recommend sticking to bitwise immutability."

    "title": "Two Way Client Observers | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc THE BELOW IS WRONG!!!!!! In addition to regular, one-way Client Observers , Orleans also provides an advanced feature of two-way (RPC) client observers. This feature allows a grain to make a call into a client observer and receive a response back. Programming Interface To enable this feature start with writing a regular client observer - a class that extends IGrainObserver interface. To make it two-way you need to add the following: 1) Add a [Factory(FactoryAttribute.FactoryTypes.ClientObject)] attribute on this class. 2) Change the methods signatures to be async (return Task or Task<T> ). From now on follow the regular observers programming pattern: call CreateObjectReference() to create an observer reference and then send it to a grain that will use it to notify the client. The notifying grain can use this observer reference as any regular grain reference: make calls on it and await them. Notice that since the observer reference represents a client object and not a virtual actor (grain), if the actual client is down, or the observer reference on the client was deleted (either by an explicit call to DeleteObjectReference or just garbage collected since it was not rooted), the Task returned from the call to it will break with an exception. Usage considerations and guidelines Please take into account that making RPC calls from actors (a server) to clients may sometimes be considered an anti-pattern . Traditional distributed system client server applications usually do not allow such capability. The reason is that it can potentially create too strong coupling between the client and the server , making: (a) server logic relay too much on the client logic, (b) making server resources consumption be directly impacted and controlled by the client. In traditional synchronous RPC systems making an RPC call from a server to client would mean that the server thread is blocked until the client responds, potentially taking valuable resources. In the general case of uncontrolled (and maybe even malicious) clients, this is a realy bad pattern. Therefore, traditional distributed system avoided such capability. In Orleans context we feel this feature is potentiality less dangerous since: 1) Orleans clients are usually considered part of the trusted domain, running usually as front ends in the same service deployment. Therefore, they are assumed to be non-malicious. 2) Orleans RPCs are asynchronous and essentially do not consume any additional resources beyond a regular message call (we still need to store a callback context to be able to process the response, just like we do for regular grain to grain calls, but this is a small object and its overhead is very small). One should still consider the potential dangers of using two way client RPCs with Orleans: If the grain making the call is non re-entrant (the default mode) the grain will be blocked until the response arrives or the built-in time-out occurs. It means the grain might be unresponsive for some time. Even with non malicious clients, since Orleans does not control client side resources, it cannot guarantee that client responds in a timely manner to this RPC call. As such, even in Orleans, this feature creates a tighter coupling between the client and the server, which is generally undesired. Therefore, our recommendation is to use this feature sparsely, only if you fully control and trust the client code, and if all other alternative solutions (regular one way client side observers and client streams ) do not work for your scenario."

    "href": "Documentation/Advanced-Concepts/Timers-and-Reminders.html",
    "title": "Timers and Reminders | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc The Orleans runtime provides two mechanisms, called timers and reminders, that enable the developer to specify periodic behavior for grains. Timers Description Timers are used to create periodic grain behavior that isn't required to span multiple activations (instantiations of the grain). It is essentially identical to the standard . NET System.Threading.Timer class. In addition, it is subject to single threaded execution guarantees within the grain activation that it operates. Each activation may have zero or more timers associated with it. The runtime executes each timer routine within the runtime context of the activation that it is associated with. Usage To start a timer, use the Grain.RegisterTimer method, which returns an IDisposable reference: protected IDisposable RegisterTimer(Func<object, Task> asyncCallback, object state, TimeSpan dueTime, TimeSpan period) asyncCallback is the function to be invoked when the timer ticks. state is an object that will be passed to asyncCallback when the timer ticks. dueTime specifies a quantity of time to wait before issuing the first timer tick. period specifies the period of the timer. Cancel the timer by disposing it. A timer will cease to trigger if the activation is deactivated or when a fault occurs and its silo crashes. Important Considerations When activation collection is enabled, the execution of a timer callback does not change the activation's state from idle to in use. This means that a timer cannot be used to postpone deactivation of otherwise idle activations. The period passed to Grain.RegisterTimer is the amount of time that passes from the moment the Task returned by asyncCallback is resolved to the moment that the next invocation of asyncCallback should occur. This not only makes it impossible for successive calls to asyncCallback to overlap but also makes it so that the length of time asyncCallback takes to complete affects the frequency at which asyncCallback is invoked. This is an important deviation from the semantics of System.Threading.Timer . Each invocation of asyncCallback is delivered to an activation on a separate turn and will never run concurrently with other turns on the same activation. Note however, asyncCallback invocations are not delivered as messages and are thus not subject to message interleaving semantics. This means that invocations of asyncCallback should be considered to behave as if running on a reentrant grain with respect to other messages to that grain. Reminders Description Reminders are similar to timers with a few important differences: Reminders are persistent and will continue to trigger in all situations (including partial or full cluster restarts) unless explicitly cancelled. Reminders are associated with a grain, not any specific activation. If a grain has no activation associated with it and a reminder ticks, one will be created. e.g.: If an activation becomes idle and is deactivated, a reminder associated with the same grain will reactivate the grain when it ticks next. Reminders are delivered by message and are subject to the same interleaving semantics as all other grain methods. Reminders should not be used for high-frequency timers-- their period should be measured in minutes, hours, or days. Configuration Reminders, being persistent, rely upon storage to function. You must specify which storage backing to use before the reminder subsystem will function. The reminder functionality is controlled by the SystemStore element in the server-side configuration. It works with either Azure Table or SQL Server as the store. <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"AzureTable\" /> OR <SystemStore SystemStoreType=\"SqlServer\" /> If you just want a placeholder implementation of reminders to work with without needing to set up an Azure account or SQL database, then adding this element to the configuration file (under 'Globals') will give you a development-only implementation of the reminder system: <ReminderService ReminderServiceType=\"ReminderTableGrain\"/> Usage A grain that uses reminders must implement the IRemindable.RecieveReminder method. Task IRemindable.ReceiveReminder(string reminderName, TickStatus status) { Console.WriteLine(\"Thanks for reminding me-- I almost forgot!\"); return TaskDone.Done; } To start a reminder, use the Grain.RegisterOrUpdateReminder method, which returns an IOrleansReminder object: protected Task<IOrleansReminder> RegisterOrUpdateReminder(string reminderName, TimeSpan dueTime, TimeSpan period) reminderName is a string that must uniquely identify the reminder within the scope of the contextual grain. dueTime specifies a quantity of time to wait before issuing the first timer tick. period specifies the period of the timer. Since reminders survive the lifetime of any single activation, they must be explicitly cancelled (as opposed to being disposed). You cancel a reminder by calling Grain.UnregisterReminder : protected Task UnregisterReminder(IOrleansReminder reminder) reminder is the handle object returned by Grain.RegisterOrUpdateReminder . Instances of IOrleansReminder aren't guaranteed to be valid beyond the lifespan of an activation. If you wish to identify a reminder in a way that persists, use a string containing the reminder's name. If you only have the reminder's name and need the corresponding instance of IOrleansReminder , call the Grain.GetReminder method: protected Task<IOrleansReminder> GetReminder(string reminderName) Which Should I Use? We recommend that you use timers in the following circumstances: It doesn't matter (or is desirable) that the timer ceases to function if the activation is deactivated or failures occur. If the resolution of the timer is small (e.g. reasonably expressible in seconds or minutes). The timer callback can be started from Grain.OnActivateAsync or when a grain method is invoked. We recommend that you use reminders in the following circumstances: When the periodic behavior needs to survive the activation and any failures. To perform infrequent tasks (e.g. reasonably expressible in minutes, hours, or days). Combining Timers and Reminders You might consider using a combination of reminders and timers to accomplish your goal. For example, if you need a timer with a small resolution that needs to survive across activations, you can use a reminder that runs every five minutes, whose purpose is to wake up a grain that restarts a local timer that may have been lost due to a deactivation."

    "title": "Serialization and Writing Custom Serializers | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Orleans Serialization Orleans has an advanced and extensible serialization framework. Orleans serializes data types passed in grain request and response messages as well as grain persistent state objects. As part of this framework, Orleans automatically generates serialization code for those data types. Orleans serialization is compatible with the standard .NET binary serialization but is more efficient and provides more compact representation. In addition to generating a more efficient serialization/deserialization for types that are already .NET-serializable, Orleans also tries to generate serializers for types used in grain interfaces that are not .NET-serializable. The framework also includes a set of efficient built-in serializers for frequently used types: lists, dictionaries, strings, primitives, arrays, etc. There are 2 important features of Orleans's serializer that set it apart from a lot of other third party serialization frameworks: dynamic types/arbitrary polymorphism and object identity. Dynamic types and arbitrary polymorphism - Orleans does not put any restrictions on the types that can be passed in grain calls and maintains the dynamic nature of the actual data type. That means, for example, that if the method in the grain interfaces is declared to accept IDictionary but at runtime the sender passes SortedDictionary , the receiver will indeed get SortedDictionary (although the \"static contract\"/grain interface did not specify this behaviour). Maintaining Object identity - if the same object is passed multiple types in the arguments of a grain call or is indirectly pointed more than once from the arguments, Orleans will serialize it only once. At the receiver side Orleans will restore all references correctly, so that two pointers to the same object still point to the same object after deserialization as well. Object identity is important to preserve in scenarios like the following. Imagine actor A is sending a dictionary with 100 entries to actor B, and 10 of the keys in the dictionary point to the same object, obj, on A's side. Without preserving object identity, B would receive a dictionary of 100 entries with those 10 keys pointing to 10 different clones of obj. With object identity preserved, the dictionary on B's side looks exactly like on A's side with those 10 keys pointing to a single object obj. The above two behaviours are provided by the standard .NET binary serializer and it was therefore important for us to support this standard and familiar behaviour in Orleans as well. Auto Generated Serializers Orleans uses the following rules to decide which serializers to generate. The rules are: 1) Go over all grain interface and grain class implementation assemblies (these are the assemblies that have the code gen step defined on them via referencing Orleans templates nuget). 2) Out of those assemblies: generate serializers for types that are directly referenced in grain interfaces method signatures or state class signature or for any type that is marked with [Serializable] attribute. 3) In addition, a grain interface or implementation project can point to arbitrary types for serialization generation by adding a [KnownType] or [KnownAssembly] assembly level attributes to tell code generator to generate serializers for a specific types or all eligible types within an assembly. Writing Custom Serializers In addition to automatic serialization generation, application code can provide custom serialization for types it chooses. Orleans recommends using the automatic serialization generation for the majority of your application types and only write custom serializers in rare cases when you believe it is possible to get improved performance by hand-coding serializers. This note describes how to do so, and identifies some specific cases when it might be helpful. There are 2 ways how application can customize serialization: 1) Add 3 serialization methods to your type and mark them with appropriate attributes ( CopierMethod , SerializerMethod , DeserializerMethod ). This method is preferable for types that your application owns, that is, the types that you can add new methods to. 2) Write a separate class annotated with an attribute RegisterSerializerAttribute with the 3 serialization methods in it. This method is useful for types that the application does not own, for example, types defined in other libraries your application has no control over. In both way the custom serialization code has to include three routines: one to make a deep copy of an object of the type; one to write a tokenized byte representation of an object of the type to a byte stream; and one to recreate a new object of the type from a tokenized byte stream. Introduction As described in Using Immutable to Optimize Copying , Orleans serialization happens in three stages: objects are immediately deep copied to ensure isolation; before being put on the wire; objects are serialized to a message byte stream; and when delivered to the target activation, objects are recreated (deserialized) from the received byte stream. Data types that may be sent in messages -- that is, types that may be passed as method arguments or return values -- must have associated routines that perform these three steps. We refer to these routines collectively as the serializers for a data type. The copier for a type stands alone, while the serializer and deserializer are a pair that work together. You can provide just a custom copier, or just a custom serializer and a custom deserializer, or you can provide custom implementations of all three. Serializers are registered for each supported data type at silo start-up and whenever an assembly is loaded. Registration is necessary for custom serializer routines for a type to be used. Serializer selection is based on the dynamic type of the object to be copied or serialized. For this reason, there is no need to create serializers for abstract classes or interfaces, because they will never be used. When to Consider Writing a Custom Serializer It is rare that a hand-crafted serializer routine will perform meaningfully better than the generated versions. If you are tempted to do so, you should first consider the following options: If there are fields or properties within your data types that don't have to be serialized or copied, you can mark them with the NonSerialized attribute. This will cause the generated code to skip these fields when copying and serializing. Use Immutable where possible to avoid copying immutable data. See Using Immutable to Optimize Copying for details. If you're avoiding using the standard generic collection types, don't. The Orleans runtime contains custom serializers for the generic collections that use the semantics of the collections to optimize copying, serializing, and deserializing. These collections also have special \"abbreviated\" representations in the serialized byte stream, resulting in even more performance advantages. For instance, a Dictionary<string, string> will be faster than a List<Tuple<string, string>> . The most common case where a custom serializer can provide a noticeable performance gain is when there is significant semantic information encoded in the data type that is not available by simply copying field values. For instance, arrays that are sparsely populated may often be more efficiently serialized by treating the array as a collection of index/value pairs, even if the application keeps the data as a fully realized array for speed of operation. A key thing to do before writing a custom serializer is to make sure that the generated serializer is really hurting your performance. Profiling will help a bit here, but even more valuable is running end-to-end stress tests of your application with varying serialization loads to gauge the system-level impact, rather than the micro-impact of serialization. For instance, building a test version that passes no parameters to or results from grain methods, simply using canned values at either end, will zoom in on the impact of serialization and copying on system performance. Method 1: Adding 3 Serialization Routines to your Type All serializer routines should be implemented as static members of the class or struct they operate on. The names shown here are not required; registration is based on the presence of the respective attributes, not on method names. Note that serializer methods need not be public. Unless you implement all three serialization routines, you should mark your type with the Serializable attribute so that the missing methods will be generated for you. Copier Copier methods are flagged with the Orleans.CopierMethod attribute: [CopierMethod]} static private object Copy(object input) { ... } Copiers are usually the simplest serializer routines to write. They take an object, guaranteed to be of the same type as the type the copier is defined in, and must return a semantically-equivalent copy of the object. If, as part of copying the object, a sub-object needs to be copied, the best way to do so is to use the SerializationManager's DeepCopyInner routine: var fooCopy = SerializationManager.DeepCopyInner(foo); It is important to use DeepCopyInner, instead of DeepCopy, in order to maintain the object identity context for the full copy operation. Maintaining Object Identity An important responsibility of a copy routine is to maintain object identity. The Orleans runtime provides a helper class for this. Before copying a sub-object \"by hand\" (i.e., not by calling DeepCopyInner), check to see if it has already been referenced as follows: var fooCopy = SerializationContext.Current.CheckObjectWhileCopying(foo); if (fooCopy == null) { // Actually make a copy of foo SerializationContext.Current.RecordObject(foo, fooCopy); } The last line, the call to RecordObject, is required so that possible future references to the same object as foo references will get found properly by CheckObjectWhileCopying. Note that this should only be done for class instances, not struct instances or .NET primitives (strings, Uris, enums). If you use DeepCopyInner to copy sub-objects, then object identity is handled for you. Serializer Serialization methods are flagged with the SerializerMethod attribute: [SerializerMethod] static private void Serialize(object input, BinaryTokenStreamWriter stream, Type expected) { ... } As with copiers, the \"input\" object passed to a serializer is guaranteed to be an instance of the defining type. The \"expected\" type may be ignored; it is based on compile-time type information about the data item, and is used at a higher level to form the type prefix in the byte stream. To serialize sub-objects, use the SerializationManager's SerializeInner routine: SerializationManager.SerializeInner(foo, stream, typeof(FooType)); If there is no particular expected type for foo, then you can pass null for the expected type. The BinaryTokenStreamWriter class provides a wide variety of methods for writing data to the byte stream. See the class for documentation. Maintaining Object Identity As with copy routines, serialization routines must maintain object identity. If you use SerializerInner, then this is taken care of for you. If not, then before serializing a sub-object, you should do the following: int reference = SerializationContext.Current.CheckObjectWhileSerializing(foo); if (reference >= 0) { stream.WriteReference(reference); return; } SerializationContext.Current.RecordObject(foo, stream.CurrentOffset); As for copiers, this should only be done for class instances, not struct instances or .NET primitives (strings, Uris, enums), and if you use SerializeInner for sub-objects, then object identity is handled for you. Deserializer Deserialization methods are flagged with the DeserializerMethod attribute: [DeserializerMethod] static private object Deserialize(Type expected, BinaryTokenStreamReader stream) { ... } The \"expected\" type may be ignored; it is based on compile-time type information about the data item, and is used at a higher level to form the type prefix in the byte stream. The actual type of the object to be created will always be the type of the class in which the deserializer is defined. To deserialize sub-objects, use the SerializationManager's DeserializeInner routine: var foo = SerializationManager.DeserializeInner(typeof(FooType), stream); Or, alternatively, var foo = SerializationManager.DeserializeInner<FooType>(stream); If there is no particular expected type for foo, use the first call pattern and pass null for the expected type. The BinaryTokenStreamReader class provides a wide variety of methods for reading data from the byte stream. See the class for documentation. Maintaining Object Identity As with serializer routines, deserialization routines must maintain object identity. If you use DeserializerInner, then this is taken care of for you. If not, then before deserializing a sub-object, you should do the following: // Token is the object introductory token read from the stream // Typically this is done using stream.TryReadSimpleType if (token == SerializationTokenType.Reference) { var offset = stream.ReadInt(); var foo = DeserializationContext.Current.FetchReferencedObject(offset); } else { // Deserialize foo } If you use DeserializeInner for sub-objects, then object identity is handled for you. Method 2: Writing a Special Serialization Class In this method you write a new class annotated with an attribute RegisterSerializerAttribute and put the 3 serialization routines in it. The rules for how to write those routines are identical to method 1. The only difference is how they are hooked up with the rest of Orleans serialization framework. Below is an example for such a class: [Orleans.CodeGeneration.RegisterSerializerAttribute()] internal class MyObjectSerializationExample { static MyObjectSerializationExample() { Register(); } public static object DeepCopier(object original) { ... } public static void Serializer(object untypedInput, BinaryTokenStreamWriter stream, Type expected) { ... } public static object Deserializer(Type expected, BinaryTokenStreamReader stream) { ... } public static void Register() { SerializationManager.Register(typeof(MyObject), DeepCopier, Serializer, Deserializer); } } Hints for Writing Serializers and Deserializers Often the simplest way to write a serializer/deserializer pair is to serialize by constructing a byte array and writing the array length to the stream, followed by the array itself, and then deserialize by reversing the process. If the array is fixed-length, you can omit it from the stream. This works well when you have a data type that you can represent compactly and that doesn't have sub-objects that might be duplicated (so you don't have to worry about object identity). Another approach, which is the approach the Orleans runtime takes for collections such as dictionaries, works well for classes with significant and complex internal structure: use instance methods to access the semantic content of the object, serialize that content, and deserialize by setting the semantic contents rather than the complex internal state. In this approach, inner objects are written using SerializeInner and read using DeserializeInner. In this case, it is common to write a custom copier, as well. If you write a custom serializer, and it winds up looking like a sequence of calls to SerializeInner for each field in the class, you don't need a custom serializer for that class."

    "title": "Runtime Monitoring | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc [[THIS IS IN NEED OF REVIEW]] There are five ways Orleans deployment can be monitored by an external operator by utilizing the data that Orleans writes automatically to Azure storage. The tables mentioned below are desribed in more details here . OrleansSilosTable for cluster membership - this table lists all silos in the deployment (partition key DeploymentID, row key silo id). The operator can use this table to check cluster health, watch the current set of live silos, or learn why and when a certain silo went down. Orleans' cluster membership protocol uses this table internally and updates it with significant membership events (silos goes up and down). OrleansSiloMetrics table for coarse grain performance statistics - Orleans writes a small number (about 10) of coarse-grain performance stats into this table (partition key DeplomentID, row key silo id). The table is updated automatically every X seconds (configurable) for each silo. The metrics include silo CPU, memory usage, number of grain activations on this silo, number of messages in the send/receive queue, etc. This data can be used to compare silos, check that there are no significant outliers (for example, one silo runs at much higher CPU), or simply check that in general the metrics reported by silos are in the expected range. In addition, this data can be used to decide to add new silos if the system becomes overloaded or reduce the number of silos if the system is mostly idle. OrleansSiloStatistics table - this table includes a much larger number of performance statistics (hundreds of counters) which provide a much more detailed and in-depth view of the internal silo state. This table is currently not recommended for use by external operators. It is mainly for Orleans developers to help them troubleshoot complex production problems, if they occur. The Orleans team is building tools to analyze this data automatically and provide compact recommendations to operators based on it. Such tools can also be built by anyone independently. Watching error codes in MDS - Orleans automatically writes different error messages into logger. This logger can be configured to output its data to various destinations. For example, the Halo team redirects all logs in production to MDS. They have written custom alerts in MDS to watch for specific error codes and count their occurrences, and alert them when those reach a certain threshold. The list of important error codes to watch is specified here: Silo Error Code Monitoring Client Error Code Monitoring Windows performance counters - The Orleans runtime continually updates a number of them. CounterControl.exe helps register the counters, and needs to run with elevated privileges. Obviously, the performance counters can be monitored using any of the standard monitoring tools."

    "title": "Unit Testing Grains | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Unit Testing Grains This tutorial shows you how to write unit tests for your grains to make sure they are behaving correctly. For a distributed application written in Orleans, you'll need load tests and integration tests as well but here we'll only focus on unit tests. Orleans makes it possible to mock many of its parts but here we only focus on simply running grains in test silos. The steps are You should create a test project in your favorite unit testing framework. Add references to Microsoft.Orleans.TestingHost and Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansProviders packages from NuGet to the project. Reference your interfaces and collection projects in the test project. Inherit your test classes from Orleans.TestingHost.TestingSiloHost . Shutdown the silo properly in each test class. The process The TestingSiloHost creates a mini cluster of 2 silos in 2 different AppDomains and initializes a client in the main AppDomain which test cases will run on, in its constructor. Then it will run all of the test cases in the class and at cleanup time shuts the silos down. The test cases like ordinary grain code should call grains and then wait for the results using await and should not block the execution. Writing the code The TestingSiloHost which we inherit from starts the silos up for us but we need to shutdown them ourselves. The samples here are using MS Test but you can use NUnit, XUnit or any other testing framework that you want. Let's use the hello world sample's code here as an example. using System; using System.Threading.Tasks; using HelloWorldInterfaces; using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting; using Orleans; using Orleans.TestingHost; namespace Tests { [TestClass] public class HelloWorldSiloTests : TestingSiloHost { [ClassCleanup] public static void ClassCleanup() { // Optional. // By default, the next test class which uses TestignSiloHost will // cause a fresh Orleans silo environment to be created. StopAllSilos(); } [TestMethod] public async Task SayHelloTest() { // The Orleans silo / client test environment is already set up at this point. const long id = 0; const string greeting = \"Bonjour\"; IHello grain = GrainFactory.GetGrain<IHello>(id); // This will create and call a Hello grain with specified 'id' in one of the test silos. string reply = await grain.SayHello(greeting); Assert.IsNotNull(reply, \"Grain replied with some message\"); string expected = string.Format(\"You said: '{0}', I say: Hello!\", greeting); Assert.AreEqual(expected, reply, \"Grain replied with expected message\"); } } } As you can see having ClassCleanup() is optional but it's good to have it around. Our test method simply creates a grain, sends the message to it and then first checks if the result is null or not and then checks if it is in the expected format or not. So writing tests for Orleans is not much different from a normal test project. You just need to reference the two NuGet packages and derive your class from TestingSiloHost . Remarks Keep in mind that the silo will not be restarted after each test method so if your methods need a fully clean grain then make sure that they'll use different grain IDs. The TestingSiloHost class has multiple utility methods for starting and stopping silos which can be used for programmatic simulation of some failure situations. Starting and stopping the silo for each test case takes time and is not a good idea unless you really need it for a test. The two created silos will be named \"Primary\" and \"Secondary\". It is importnat to note that the notion of a Primary silo is only used in Testing. We use the Primary silo to host the system store in a special MembershipTableGrain system grain, to allow bootstrap. In production there is no primary and secondary silos: all silos are equal and behave in a peer-to-peer fashion. Configurations of the environment are based on TestSiloOptions and TestClientOptions objects which can be passed to the constructor of the base class."

    "title": "Running in a Stand-Alone Silo | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Running in a Stand-Alone Silo In the first tutorial , we got a very simple \"Hello World!\" Orleans application running in the simplest possible environment, a dev/test host where everything is running in one process, which makes starting and stopping it really easy. For most of your initial development of grain-based applications and services, that environment will be ideal. However, one thing that is hard to test in such an environment is what happens when the client and server do not get started and stopped at the same time. Often, state is maintained on the server across client sessions, something that is hard to model using the single-process setup. Therefore, what we're going to do now is modify the solution we finished up with in the first tutorial and make it just a bit more like a production environment, running the server and client code in different processes. Getting Started The first thing we need to do is get the grain code running in a silo that is in a separate process and prevent it from being started by the code in Program.cs . To do the latter, remove the code that starts the silo in its own app domain, as well as the code that shuts it down at the end. One consequence of not running the silo from the same process is that the client code has to wait for the silo to be ready to accept incoming requests. Rather than adding some clever backoff-retry code, here we simply expect you to wait for the silo to start, then hit 'Enter' in the client console window when the silo is advertising its readiness. This is the result: static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(\"Waiting for Orleans Silo to start. Press Enter to proceed...\"); Console.ReadLine(); Orleans.GrainClient.Initialize(\"ClientConfiguration.xml\"); } Now you should add reference to Microsoft.Orleans.Server NuGet package to your collection project and then in its project properties in Debug tab set the bin/Debug/OrleansHost.exe or bin/Release/OrleansHost.exe file as startup program for your collections class library. You also need to change the client gateway port in the OrleansConfiguration.xml file added to the collection project by Microsoft.Orleans.Server to match the gateway port specified in DevTestClientConfiguration.xml. Open OrleansConfiguration.xml, find the ProxyingGateway element inside its Defaults section, and change it to. <ProxyingGateway Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"30000\" /> OrleansHost.exe is a ready-made host executable intended for running Orleans silo code. It is also useful for development purposes. If you set both the grain collection project and the the host project as startup projects, you will see two windows come up: This allows us to debug the grains in their own process, while keeping the client code in its own process. If you let the client make its request, then terminate it using 'Enter' when asked, you should see only the client process windows disappear. The debugging session won't end, because the grains are still being debugged in the OrleansHost.exe process. To start the client again, you will have to use the right-button context menu in the Solution Explorer to get it started. Keeping Things Around To demonstrate keeping state around across client sessions, let's modify the SayHello() method to take a string argument. Then, we will have our grain save each string it is sent and return the last one. Only at the first greeting will we see something we didn't send to the grain from the client. private string text = \"Hello World!\"; public Task<string> SayHello(string greeting) { var oldText = text; text = greeting; return Task.FromResult(oldText); } We also change the client to send a greeting several times: var hello = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IGrain1>(0); Console.WriteLine(hello.SayHello(\"First\").Result); Console.WriteLine(hello.SayHello(\"Second\").Result); Console.WriteLine(hello.SayHello(\"Third\").Result); Console.WriteLine(hello.SayHello(\"Fourth\").Result); What we would expect to see here is four greetings, the first of which is \"Hello World!\". Let's check it out: Terminate the client (make sure it's just the client, we need the grain host to stay up) and restart it using the context menu. There's no reason to wait for the silo now, since it's already running. Here's what we get: Still four greetings, but instead of \"Hello World!\" the first greeting is the last one from our previous client session. In other words, the grain in the silo kept some state around for us. Next So far, we've only seen one single grain type and a single instance of that type. It has served to keep things simple for the purpose of explaining how the environment works, but it is not typical of Orleans code. In the next tutorial, we will see something more realistic.

    "title": "On-Premise Deployment | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc On-Premise Deployment Overview While using Orleans to implement cloud-based services is a core scenario, there is nothing that intrinsically ties it to the cloud as the sole platform. Orleans can just as well be deployed to the internal, on-premise, equipment of your organization's. In this tutorial, we describe the steps to take. Orleans based services are xcopy-deployable. All you need to do to deploy an Orleans based service to a set of machines is copy the following set of file to the target machines and start the OrleansHost.exe host process: Contents of the Orleans SDK .\\Binaries\\OrleansServer folder OrleansConfiguration.xml file with configuration for the deployment to replace the default placeholder from .\\Binaries\\OrleansServer Binaries with grain interfaces and grain implementation classes of the service along with any external dependencies to Application<service name> subdirectory of the folder on the target with binaries from .\\Binaries\\OrleansServer . This simple task may be accomplished in many different ways and with different tools, but the Orleans GitHub repo includes a set of PowerShell scripts ( https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/misc/scripts/RemoteDeployment ) that provide a way to deploy an Orleans based service to a cluster of machines and remote start the hosting processes on them. There are also scripts for removing a service, monitoring its performance, starting and stopping it, and collecting logs. These are the scripts we found useful for ourselves while building and testing Orleans. Prerequisites The following table lists the prerequisites for deploying and running Orleans on a remote machine: .Net Framework 4.5 Orleans runs under the .Net Framework 4.5, which can be installed from this link: ( http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653 ) Powershell 2.0 with WinRM Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 should have these installed by default. For earlier versions of Windows, select the appropriate download from this article: ( http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968929 ). To confirm you are running the required version of PowerShell, start a PowerShell window and type Get-Host – the resulting output needs to say \"Version: 2.0\" WinRM Configuration Both the source and target machines must be configured for remote operations: Open a PowerShell window as an Administrator and run the command below on the target machine (enter 'y' at the prompts): winrm quickconfig Increase PowerShell job memory Set the memory limit on remotely invoked jobs to 4Gb: Set-Item wsman:localhost\\Shell\\MaxMemoryPerShellMB 4096 To change it on a remote machine, use the following steps: Connect-WSMan -ComputerName <string> Set-Item wsman:<computerName>\\Shell\\MaxMemoryPerShellMB Disconnect-WSMan –ComputerName <string> PowerShell Execution Policy set to run remote scripts Open a PowerShell window as an Administrator and run the command below on the target machine (enter 'y' at the prompt): Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned This will set the machine to require signing for remote scripts only. Note that the user running the scripts must be a member of the Administrators Group on the remote machines. Deployment Steps In this tutorial , we will deploy the HelloWorld sample to a set of servers. The Orleans repo includes a RemoteDeployment folder ( https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/misc/scripts/RemoteDeployment ) where everything we need can be found. Start by building the Hello World sample , commenting out (or removing) the silo initialization and shutdown code: static void Main(string[] args) { //AppDomain hostDomain = // AppDomain.CreateDomain(\"OrleansHost\", null, new AppDomainSetup //{ // AppDomainInitializer = InitSilo, // AppDomainInitializerArguments = args, //}); Orleans.GrainClient.Initialize(\"ClientConfiguration.xml\"); var friend = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<HelloWorldInterfaces.IHello>(0); Console.WriteLine(\"\\n\\n{0}\\n\\n\", friend.SayHello(\"Good morning!\").Result); Console.WriteLine(\"Orleans Silo is running.\\nPress Enter to terminate...\"); Console.ReadLine(); //hostDomain.DoCallBack(ShutdownSilo); } Also, start a new PowerShell window as Administrator and move to the RemoteDeployment folder. The basic steps to deploy Orleans code are: Setup a deployment manifest (Deployment.xml) . Adjust the Orleans server-side configuration (OrleansConfiguration.xml) to suit the environment. Run the PowerShell deployment scripts to deploy Orleans into your remote environment. Orleans Deployment Manifest The Orleans Deployment scripts use a manifest (XML) file to specify details of the deployment, including source and destination locations and local or remote machines to be deployed to. By making small changes to an existing deployment manifest xml file (typically by listing the different host machines), the same PowerShell scripts can deploy and run that Orleans system on a set of remote machines with equal ease as deploying and running that system on the local machine. The default file name for the manifest is Deployment.xml , and if you just modify this file, which is found in the RemoteDeployment folder, it will not be necessary to specify a different name. There are times, such as during testing, it may be advantageous to maintain multiple deployment files that specify a different set of silos. These other files may be specified explicitly to the deployment tools as specified in the respective sections below. A deployment manifest contains many different items, which collectively allow deployment of the Orleans runtime and applications onto a variety of local and remote configurations: Source location for the Orleans system runtime Located in the Path attribute of the <Deployment><Packages><Package> element where the Type attribute is set to \"System\". <Package Name=\"Orleans Runtime\" Type=\"System\" Path=\"..\\Binaries\\OrleansServer\" /> Source location for additional Orleans applications If you have any additional Orleans applications / grains to be included in this Orleans system, they are also located in the <Deployment><Packages><Package> nodes. The Type attribute must be set to \"Application\". <Package Name=\"HelloWorld\" Type=\"Application\" Path=\"..\\Binaries\\Applications\\HelloWorldGrains\" /> Source location for the server configuration file to be used by the Orleans host process Located in the Path attribute of the <Deployment><RuntimeConfiguration> element. The file name must be \"OrleansConfiguration.xml\" – if necessary, just change the path. <RuntimeConfiguration Path=\".\\OrleansConfiguration.xml\" /> Target location to install the Orleans server-side binaries on each machine Located in the <Deployment><TargetLocation> element. This must be an absolute local file system path (i.e. no \"..\" locations) that is valid on all the target hosts. <TargetLocation Path=\"C:\\Orleans\" /> The set of silos (host machines and optional silo names) this Orleans system should to be deployed to. Located in the <Deployment><Nodes><Node> elements. Typically: \"Primary\" on localhost , or multiple machines with one silo each. The HostName attribute specifies the machine name. The NodeName attribute specifies the name of the silo. Generally, this is arbitrary, with the exception that if multiple silos will run on any one machine, then silo names must be unique. <Nodes> <Node HostName=\"MACHINE1\" NodeName=\"Primary\" /> <Node HostName=\"MACHINE2\" NodeName=\"Node2\" /> <Node HostName=\"MACHINE3\" NodeName=\"Node3\" /> <Nodes /> Deployment Group ID This is a GUID which distinguishes one Orleans runtime system from another, even if both Orleans systems are running on the same machines. Located in the <Deployment> element. <Deployment Name=\"Deployment1\" DeploymentGroup=\"F219832A-1EE1-45DA-B35D-0BB3060C9FDA\" xmlns=\"urn:xcg-deployment\"> Orleans Silo Configuration Refer to Server Configuration for information on silo configuration. Orleans Powershell Scripts The following sections detail the PowerShell scripts provided with Orleans to aid with deployment and monitoring. (Use the /? option to get the latest usage info directly from the scripts.) Script Name Parameters Description DeployOrleansSilos.ps1 [$deploymentConfigFile] Copies the Orleans files to machines specified in the deploymentConfigFile (default is Deployment.xml). UndeployOrleansSilos.ps1 [$deploymentConfigFile] Stops and removes Orleans from the deployment servers deploymentConfigFile (default is Deployment.xml). MonitorOrleansSilos.ps1 [$deploymentConfigFile] [$networkInstance] [$samplesToLog] [$headerInterval] [$repeatHeaderInFile] Monitors CPU, Memory, Network Send, and Network Receive performance counters, and logs the data to files both as an aggregate of all data, and in separate files for each server.

GatherOrleansSiloLogs.ps1 [$deploymentConfigFile] [$outputPath] Retrieve all log files from deployment silos and stores them in the specified output folder. UtilityFunctions.ps1 none Provides ancillary functionality to the other scripts. Deploying Orleans using Powershell Script Start a separate PowerShell command window as an administrator. Execute the DeployOrleansSilos.ps1 script, providing the location of the deployment configuration file (\"deployment.xml\" is the default and will be used if you don’t supply a value). .\\DeployOrleansSilos.ps1 .\\Deployment.xml The deployment will execute the following steps: Stop any running instances of Orleans that are running on the deployment machines. Copy the Orleans files and any application files that are listed in the deployment manifest. When the copy is completed, start the silos. This will pause after starting the first silo so that it is available for the other silos to register with. Pause to allow the start-up to complete. Report the progress of the deployment. When the deployment is complete, Orleans is ready for clients to connect to it. Confirming Orleans Status To determine if Orleans is running on the servers in the deployment manifest, run the ShowOrleansSilos.ps1 script. If you have used a deployment manifest file named something other than the default, specify it on the command line. .\\ShowOrleansSilos.ps1 .\\Deployment.xml If everything works well, you should see something like this: PS C:\\Orleans\\misc\\scripts\\RemoteDeployment> .\\ShowOrleansSilos.ps1 .\\Deployment.xml OrleansHost running on host001: Process 1: 1340 OrleansHost running on host002: Process 1: 4320 2 processes running Running the Client We've edited the Hello World program not to start a silo in-process, but in order to run the client, the client configuration file DevTestClientConfiguratio.xml needs to be edited according to the Client Configuration section. The setup needs to conform to how the server was set up, specifically whether or not Azure Storage is used to keep track of the deployment configuration. In the author's setup, Azure is not involved, so the client configuration looks like this: <ClientConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Gateway Address=\"host001\" Port=\"30000\"/> <Gateway Address=\"host002\" Port=\"30000\"/> <Statistics MetricsTableWriteInterval=\"30s\" PerfCounterWriteInterval=\"30s\" LogWriteInterval=\"300s\" WriteLogStatisticsToTable=\"true\"/> </ClientConfiguration> which corresponds to a server configuration that looks like this (relevant excerpts only): <Globals> <SeedNode Address=\"host001\" Port=\"11111\" /> <Liveness LivenessType =\"MembershipTableGrain\" /> ... </Globals> <Defaults> <Networking Address=\"\" Port=\"11111\" /> <ProxyingGateway Address=\"\" Port=\"30000\" /> ... </Defaults> Running the client in VS, I see this: Monitoring Orleans Once Orleans is deployed, you can start an optional script that will monitor the Orleans deployment using standard performance counters. Run a dedicated PowerShell command prompt as an administrator, and execute the .\\MonitorOrleans.ps1 script to start monitor performance counters for an Orleans Deployment. The following parameters configure the monitoring to suit individual circumstances: Parameter Default Description DeploymentConfigFile Deployment.xml The deployment manifest used to install Orleans. NetworkInstance corp The name of the network for the network performance counters. SamplesToLog 480 The number of samples to record in the current run. Use Ctrl-C to stop the script sooner. The default of 480, which taken in one minute intervals should continue for eight hours. HeaderInterval 10 The number of samples to write before repeating the header. RepeatHeaderInFile If this switch is present, the header will be repeated in the log file at the interval specified by the previous parameter. The script will store the data in the following types listed below. The files will be written to a folder called PerformanceData under the directory where the monitoring script is run from. File Type FileNameBase Description Machine Specific “PerfData-” + machine name + Date/Time stamp. Contains only the data for a single machine. If there are four machines in the deployment, then there will be four of these files. Combined “ConsolidatedPerfData-” + Date/Time stamp. Contains all of the data for all machines consolidated into a single file. Gathering Orleans Log Files To retrieve all log files from deployment silos and store them in the specified output folder, run the GatherOrleansSiloLogs.ps1 script. If you have used a deployment manifest file named something other than the default, specify it on the command line. You may also specify an output folder where the collected log files will be stored otherwise a .\\logs subdirectory will be used by default. .\\GatherOrleansSiloLogs.ps1 .\\Deployment.xml .\\GatherOrleansSiloLogs.ps1 .\\Deployment.xml .\\MyLogs Removing Orleans When it is time to remove an Orleans deployment, use the UndeployOrleansSilos.ps1 script. If you have used a deployment manifest file named something other than the default, specify it on the command line. .\\UnDeployOrleansSilos.ps1 .\\Deployment.xml Next We'll look at how you can deploy Orleans in the Azure Cloud Cloud Deployment"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc My First Orleans Application In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to get the simplest possible Orleans application up and running, the all-too-familiar \"Hello World!\". We're using VS 2013, but it works equally well with VS 2012. Before we start, there are three Orleans concepts that you will run into in this tutorial: that of a grain, a communication interface, and a silo. Grains Grains form the core of the Orleans programming model - they are distributed virtual actors. Grains are .NET classes that derive from a particular base class. It is easy to think about actors as objects that get dynamically instantiated on different servers and can invoke each other. They are distributed because interactions with grains may happen across process and computer boundaries, virtual because a particular grain may not be loaded in memory when another component sends it a message. If not present, the grain will be activated on-demand. Communication interfaces Communication interfaces describe how to communicate with grains. They are .NET interfaces extending a particular base interface. Silos Silos are containers of grains, potentially millions of grains in a single silo. Typically, you will run one silo per machine, but it sometimes make sense to run more than one on a single machine, when testing, for example. Getting Started After starting either Visual Studio 2012 or 2013, go to create a new project. Under \"Visual C#,\" you should see the following: Choose the \"Orleans Dev/Test Host\" project type, create a directory for the solution, and create the project: At this point go ahead and compile your project to download the packages. The project is just a console application populated with code that helps you host a silo in an environment that is \"developer friendly,\" i.e. where everything runs in a single process. The main code does three things: it creates a silo in a separate app domain, initializes the Orleans client runtime, and waits for user input before terminating: static void Main(string[] args) { // The Orleans silo environment is initialized in its own app domain in order to more // closely emulate the distributed situation, when the client and the server cannot // pass data via shared memory. AppDomain hostDomain = AppDomain.CreateDomain(\"OrleansHost\", null, new AppDomainSetup { AppDomainInitializer = InitSilo, AppDomainInitializerArguments = args, }); Orleans.GrainClient.Initialize(\"DevTestClientConfiguration.xml\"); // TODO: once the previous call returns, the silo is up and running. // This is the place your custom logic, for example calling client logic // or initializing an HTTP front end for accepting incoming requests. Console.WriteLine(\"Orleans Silo is running.\\nPress Enter to terminate...\"); Console.ReadLine(); hostDomain.DoCallBack(ShutdownSilo); } Adding Some Grains At this point, we have everything we need except some actual Orleans-based code. Next we will create two more projects, one to hold the communication interface, and one to hold our grain. Separating the two is a best practice since the interface project is shared between the client and server-side, while the grains are implementation code and should be private to the server side. In addition to the Dev/Test host, there are two more Orleans projects, and we should create one of each in our solution: Once you have them in your solution, make sure to add a reference to the grain interface project from each of the other projects: the host, which will contain our client code, and the grain collection project. Add a reference for the grain collection project to the host project, so that it is automatically (re-)built and copied when starting the debugger. Open the IGrain1.cs file and add a method SayHello() to it. We should have something like this: public interface IGrain1 : IGrainWithIntegerKey { Task<string> SayHello(); } One of the important things is choosing a Key type for your grains, in this example we are using the Integer Key type. There are also Guids, strings and various compound keys that may meet your needs. Additionally, Orleans relies on TPL tasks in the interface method's return type -- an essential means to achieving scalability in the lightweight Orleans programming model is to use asynchronous I/O everywhere, and Orleans forces you to do so. Use Task or Task<T> as the return type of all methods of communication interfaces. Next, we turn our attention to the grain implementation, which is found in Grain1.cs . The first thing to do is make sure that the interface it implements is the right one: it should be MyGrainInterfaces1.IGrain1 , unless you renamed the project and/or the interface in the previous step. Then, we ask VS to generate the method stub for the one interface method we defined earlier: public Task<string> SayHello() { throw new NotImplementedException(); } We're finally ready to add the much-anticipated \"Hello World!\" code. Just return the string as the contents of a Task: public Task<string> SayHello() { return Task.FromResult(\"Hello World!\"); } OK, we're nearly done. All we need is a bit of client code, which we will return to Program.cs in order to add. In place of the comment following the call to GrainClient.Initialize() , add these two lines: var friend = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<MyGrainInterfaces1.IGrain1>(0); Console.WriteLine(\"\\n\\n{0}\\n\\n\", friend.SayHello().Result); That's it! Hit F5, let the silo initialization code take its time. This will take a few seconds, maybe as much as ten, and there will be a lot of log messages printed. At the very end, you should see the printout of the greeting. These are the essential steps to create and run Orleans-based code: define communication interfaces, implement them using grain classes, and write some client code to communicate with the grains in order to test them. In a realistic production environment, the grain code would be deployed in a silo hosted by Windows Azure or Windows Server and the client would most likely be a Web site or service using Orleans for the backend logic. However, that is just about making different configuration choices - the code in the simplified environment is the same as in the production environment. Next Next we'll see how we can run this sample in a stand-alone silo. Running in a Stand-alone Silo"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Minimal Orleans Application This tutorial provides step by step instructions for creating a basic functioning Orleans application. It is designed to be self-contained and minimalistic, with the following traits. It does not need the SDK or Extension to be installed, and relies on the Nuget packages only. Tested in both Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 using Orleans 1.0.9. Has no reliance on SQL or Azure Keep in mind, this is only a tutorial and lacks appropriate error handling and other goodies that would be useful for a production environment. However, it should help the reader get a real hands-on for all the different facets of Orleans and allow them to focus their continued learning on the parts most relevant to them. Project Setup For this tutorial we’re going to need to create 3 projects. A Library that contains the interfaces (Communication interfaces), a library that contains the implementation (Called Grains), and a simple console application that will Host our Silo. For further understanding of this terminology please see the document Getting Started with Orleans. The Solution will eventually look like this. (Missing files will be added in sections below) Within Visual Studio Create a blank solution called OrleansTest Create a New Console Application called Host Create a New class library called GrainInterfaces Create a New class library called GrainCollection We use just the default project types in c#. Delete the Extras Delete Class1.cs from GrainCollection Delete Class1.cs from GrainInterfaces Add the following References GrainCollection References GrainInterfaces Host References GrainInterfaces Host References GrainCollection Adding Orleans Orleans is available via Nuget. The primary goodness is in Microsoft.Orleans.Core but we will be including packages that provide additional functionality. Specifically, we will be using Template packages, which provide the autocode generation for us our Grains and Interfaces, and the Runtime which is used for hosting. With Nuget Add Microsoft.Orleans.Templates.Interfaces to GrainInterfaces Add Microsoft.Orleans.Templates.Grains to GrainCollection Add Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansRuntime to Host Creating our Grain Interface In GrainInterfaces Create an interface IHello.cs public interface IHello : Orleans.IGrainWithIntegerKey { Task<string> SayHello(string msg); } Creating our Implementation In GrainCollection create a class HelloGrain.cs class HelloGrain : Orleans.Grain, IHello { public Task<string> SayHello(string msg) { return Task.FromResult(string.Format(\"You said {0}, I say: Hello!\", msg)); } } Host The host requires the most amount of attention to get Orleans up and running. Throughout future tutorials, much of this will change, or go away (Orleans comes with a nice precanned SiloHost and the Extension provides a template that simplifies this). However this small implementation should demonstrate the basics of getting started. Host – App.Config Change App.config enable the recommended server style garbage collection <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <runtime> <gcServer enabled=\"true\"/> </runtime> </configuration> Host – OrleansConfiguration.xml Within the Host project, add an XML file that will be used for cluster configuration called OrleansConfiguration.xml Make sure it is set to Copy to Output directory: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <SeedNode Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"11111\" /> </Globals> <Defaults> <Networking Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"11111\" /> <ProxyingGateway Address=\"localhost\" Port=\"30000\" /> </Defaults> </OrleansConfiguration> It is possible to configure this within the code, but it is fairly temperamental. Host – Program.cs Program.cs is our most length code block. We are attempting to accomplish a number of objectives Initialize Orleans in its own AppDomain Run a trivial example (DoSomeClientWork) Wait for the user to press enter Shutdown gracefully The Orleans samples come with a very nice class called HostWrapper, which abstracts some of the boiler plate within this example. We're going to do this by hand, but for a more robust implementation, it is worth exploring. using Orleans.Runtime.Host; using Orleans; using System.Net; class Program { static SiloHost siloHost; static void Main(string[] args) { // Orleans should run in its own AppDomain, we set it up like this AppDomain hostDomain = AppDomain.CreateDomain(\"OrleansHost\", null, new AppDomainSetup() { AppDomainInitializer = InitSilo }); DoSomeClientWork(); Console.WriteLine(\"Orleans Silo is running.\\nPress Enter to terminate...\"); Console.ReadLine(); // We do a clean shutdown in the other AppDomain hostDomain.DoCallBack(ShutdownSilo); } static void DoSomeClientWork() { // Orleans comes with a rich XML configuration but we're just going to setup a basic config var clientconfig = new Orleans.Runtime.Configuration.ClientConfiguration(); clientconfig.Gateways.Add(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 30000)); GrainClient.Initialize(clientconfig); var friend = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IHello>(0); var result = friend.SayHello(\"Goodbye\").Result; Console.WriteLine(result); } static void InitSilo(string[] args) { siloHost = new SiloHost(System.Net.Dns.GetHostName()); // The Cluster config is quirky and weird to configure in code, so we're going to use a config file siloHost.ConfigFileName = \"OrleansConfiguration.xml\"; siloHost.InitializeOrleansSilo(); var startedok = siloHost.StartOrleansSilo(); if (!startedok) throw new SystemException(String.Format(\"Failed to start Orleans silo '{0}' as a {1} node\", siloHost.Name, siloHost.Type)); } static void ShutdownSilo() { if (siloHost != null) { siloHost.Dispose(); GC.SuppressFinalize(siloHost); siloHost = null; } } } Running the application At this point we should be able to run Host. A console should appear with a large amount of logging text, at the end it should look like this Within the appropriate bin directory (Debug/Release) there will be a number of log files showing this information as well. The amount and method of logging is configurable.

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Interaction with Libraries and Services Code running in a grain is not prohibited from calling external systems or services, but the rule for always using asynchronous code must be maintained. In this sample we'll see how a grain can all out to an external service. Creating a Stock Grain For this sample, let's create a grain which maintains the current price for a stock. Create a grain interface project, and add an interface for an IStockGrain : public interface IStockGrain : Orleans.IGrainWithStringKey { Task<string> GetPrice(); } Note, we've opted for an string-based key for our grain, which is useful since the ticker symbol makes a natural key. The IGrainWithStringKey interface is new in the September refresh. Now add a grain implementation project, and add a reference to the interface project. Add a reference to System.Net.Http . We'll implement the grain so it retrieves the price of the stock when it is activated: public class StockGrain : Orleans.Grain, IStockGrain { string price; public override async Task OnActivateAsync() { string stock; this.GetPrimaryKey(out stock); await UpdatePrice(stock); await base.OnActivateAsync(); } async Task UpdatePrice(string stock) { price = await GetPriceFromYahoo(stock); } async Task<string> GetPriceFromYahoo(string stock) { var uri = \"http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?f=snl1c1p2&e=.csv&s=\" + stock; using (var http = new HttpClient()) using (var resp = await http.GetAsync(uri)) { return await resp.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); } } public Task<string> GetPrice() { return Task.FromResult(price); } } Next create some client code to connect to the Orleans Silo, and retrieve the grain state: GrainClient.Initialize(\"LocalConfiguration.xml\"); // retrieve the MSFT stock var grain = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IStockGrain>(\"MSFT\"); var price = grain.GetPrice().Result; Console.WriteLine(price); Console.ReadKey(); When we start the local silo, and run the application, we should see the stock value written out \"MSFT\",\"Microsoft Corpora\",37.70,-0.19,\"-0.50%\" Note that the extra text in the stock price is just the formatting that Yahoo! returned. Refreshing the value with a timer The problem with the grain as it stands is that the value of the stock will change, but the grain will maintain the same value for it's lifetime (an indefinite period of time). One way to fix this is to periodically refresh the price. A traditional .NET timer is not suitable for running in a grain. Instead, Orleans provides it's own timer. Let's re-factor the OnActivateAsync() method to introduce a timer which will call the UpdatePrice method in 1 minute, and then repeatedly every minute from then on, until the grain is deactivated: public override async Task OnActivateAsync() { string stock; this.GetPrimaryKey(out stock); await UpdatePrice(stock); var timer = RegisterTimer( UpdatePrice, stock, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)); await base.OnActivateAsync(); } We'll also have to slightly adjust the UpdatePrice method, as the stock argument must be an object rather than a string. We'll also add some logging so we can see what's happening: async Task UpdatePrice(object stock) { price = await GetPriceFromYahoo(stock as string); Console.WriteLine(price); } The RegisterTimer method takes four arguments: callback - A function to call. state - An object to pass as the first argument of the callback function (this can be null). dueTime - The period to wait before starting the first call to callback . period - The period between subsequent calls to callback . Note: In our sample we're passing the stock name as the state argument when we register the timer. This means the stock name is presented to the UpdatePrice method as the argument. Alternative we could set state to be null , and read the stock name from inside UpdatePrice using GetPrimaryKey . The method returns an IOrleansTimer which is disposable and can be used to stop the timer. It's a good idea to hold on to a reference to this in case you need to stop the timer. Now when we run the sample, the grain is activated, the timer gets registered and every minute the price is updated for us: \"MSFT\",\"Microsoft Corpora\",37.70,-0.19,\"-0.50%\" \"MSFT\",\"Microsoft Corpora\",37.70,-0.19,\"-0.50%\" \"MSFT\",\"Microsoft Corpora\",37.70,-0.19,\"-0.50%\" \"MSFT\",\"Microsoft Corpora\",37.70,-0.19,\"-0.50%\" Orleans is acting as an automatically refreshing cache. Whenever a stock grain is queried Orleans will provide the latest price it has, without having to make a call to the stock web service. Parallelization Running code in a single threaded execution model, does not prohibit you from await several tasks at once (or in parallel). Let's add a new function to retrieve the graph data for a stock: async Task<string> GetYahooGraphData(string stock) { // retrieve the graph data from Yahoo finance var uri = string.Format( \"http://chartapi.finance.yahoo.com/instrument/1.0/{0}/chartdata;type=quote;range=1d/csv/\",stock); using (var http = new HttpClient()) using (var resp = await http.GetAsync(uri)) { return await resp.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); } } We'll also add a new field to the grain to store this information: string graphData; Now we can retrieve the graph data and current price like this: async Task UpdatePrice(object stock) { price = await GetPriceFromYahoo(stock as string); graphData = await GetYahooGraphData(stock as string); Console.WriteLine(price); } However, by doing this we're waiting for the price from Yahoo, and after that's complete we request the graph data. This is inefficient, as we could be doing these at the same time. Fortunately, Task has a convenient WhenAll method which allows us to await multiple tasks at once, allowing these tasks to complete in parallel. async Task UpdatePrice(object stock) { // collect the task variables without awaiting var priceTask = GetPriceFromYahoo(stock as string); var graphDataTask = GetYahooGraphData(stock as string); // await both tasks await Task.WhenAll(priceTask, graphDataTask); // read the results price = priceTask.Result; graphData = graphDataTask.Result; Console.WriteLine(price); } Note: The Result of a Task will block execution if the task hasn't completed. This should be avoided in Orleans, tasks should always be awaited before Result is read. Note: When a large number of asynchronous actions need to happen simultaneously you can collect the tasks in a List<Task<T>> and present this to Task.WhenAll . External Tasks It's tempting to use the Task Parallel Library \"TPL\" for executing parallel tasks in Orleans, but TPL uses the .NET thread pool to dispatch tasks. This is prohibited within grain code. Orleans has it's own task scheduler which provides the single threaded execution model used within grains. It's important that when running tasks the Orleans scheduler is used, and not the .NET thread pool. Should your grain code require a sub-task to be created, you should use Task.Factory.StartNew : await Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>{ /* logic */ }); This technique will use the current task scheduler, which will be the Orleans scheduler. You should avoid using Task.Run , which always uses the .NET thread pool, and therefore will not run in the single-threaded execution model. Next Let's look at how Orleans can persist grain state for us: Declarative Persistence"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Step by Step Tutorials The collection of technology walkthrough tutorials found here is intended to introduce you to the features of this exciting technology, spanning the programming model, its configuration, deployment, and customization. They build on each other, so it is best to go through them in the order outlined below. Each walkthrough is focused narrowly on just a couple of specific concepts in isolation from the scenarios that motivate your using Orleans in the first place, they are intended to teach you the mechanics of Orleans, not to explain when or why you should be using them. My First Orleans Application This walkthrough shows you how to create a \"Hello World\" application using Orleans and run it in the simplest possible single-process environment, one that is convenient for debugging your code. Minimal Orleans Application This walkthrough is an alternative to the My First Orleans Application tutorial. It walks step by step through a basic application, using only the nuget packages. Running in a Stand-Alone Silo In this walkthrough, the simple \"Hello World\" application is modified to use a more typical environment for services: separate processes for the client and service code. It is still a development and debugging environment, simpler than a production configuration, which would involve multiple processes on multiple computers. Actor Identity Actors are a lot like regular objects, but there are a couple of quirks that make them different. One is the notion of actor identity, which surfaces in Orleans in the form of grains' primary keys. A Service is a Collection of Communicating Actors The previous examples used only a single actor type and instance to demonstrate their concepts. In almost all real systems, this is the opposite of what you would want to do; actors are intended to be as light-weight as objects and you would expect hundreds of thousands or millions of them to be active on a single system simultaneously, with as potentially billions waiting inactive in persistent store. This walkthrough explains the actor lifecycle and identity, how actors are activated and deactivated. Concurrency What distinguishes the actor model from most other (distributed) object models is that it enforces a specific set of rules for concurrent access to state, allowing it to be free of data races by exchanging data between actors using message-passing and only allowing a single thread of execution to access each actor's internal state at any given point in time. On the other hand, there are many situations where data races are not a risk, and the single-threaded model is too conservative. Further, single-threaded execution can cause other problems, such as deadlocks. Orleans offers a few tools that allow developers to control this behavior, explained in this walkthrough. Interaction with Libraries and Services Applications using Orleans are regular .NET applications, and can interact freely with other .NET components. In order to not undermine the scalability inherent in the actor model, programmers have to take care to follow a few rules, mostly related to using asynchronous APIs whenever they are available. This walkthrough demonstrates the basic principles. Declarative Persistence Actors are often transient, i.e., their state lives only for a short period of time, or is reconstructible at will from other actors. In many circumstances, however, actor state needs to persist for longer periods of time and be stored in an external database of some sort. Orleans offers the developer flexible options on where to store actor state, and this walkthrough will introduce the simplest way to deal with long-lived actor state: declaratively. Front Ends for Orleans Services Many Orleans services will be private and available only to front-end services that rely on the Orleans-based code as one of several backend services. In some circumstances, what is needed is to put a thin HTTP layer in front of the backend service, essentially making the Orleans service itself publically available via HTTP. In this walk-through, the steps of producing a thin HTTP layer based on ASP.NET Web API is described. Unit Testing Grains Writing tests is one of the essential parts of the software development process which allows you to maintain your code easily, refactor with ease and sleep well when a new team member is changing 3 years old code. Orleans makes it very easy to write different kinds of tests for your Orleans application. this tutorial describes how to write simple unit tests to check if each grain method is having the right behavior. More complex scenarios like load testing and object mocking are not described here. Cloud Deployment The next walkthrough demonstrates how to get your Orleans application deployed in the cloud using Azure. On-Premise Deployment Orleans applications can be deployed both on your server equipment as well as in the cloud. In this walkthrough, you will see how to set up an on premise cluster and deploy your application to it. Custom Storage Providers Defining your own storage provider is the easiest way to extend the persistence choices of your Orleans application. While Orleans comes with a couple of storage providers in the box, they are not intended to be the only choices or constrain you unnecessarily. Therefore, the library offers a way to extend the set of storage providers to include This walkthrough demonstrates how to extend the choices by building a storage provider based on regular files."

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Front Ends for Orleans Services Exposing silo gateway ports as public endpoints of an Orleans cluster is not recommended. Instead, Orleans is intended to be fronted by your own API. Creating an HTTP API, or web application is a common scenario. Let's extend the Employee/Manager scenario from the Declarative-Persistence walk-through to see what steps are required to publish grain data over HTTP. Creating the ASP.NET application First, you should add a new ASP.NET Web Application to your solution. Then, select the Web API template, although you could use MVC or Web Forms. Initializing Orleans Next, add a reference to the Orleans.dll file in the project references. Now add the ClientConfiguration.xml file used in the Orleans Host application to the root of the ASP.NET project. As with the Orleans host we created earlier, we need to initialize Orleans. This is best done in the Global.asax.cs file like this: namespace WebApplication1 { public class WebApiApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication { protected void Application_Start() { Orleans.GrainClient.Initialize(Server.MapPath(\"~/ClientConfiguration.xml\")); ... Now when the ASP.NET application starts, it will initialize the Orleans Client. Creating the Controller Now lets add a controller to the project, to receive HTTP requests, and call the grain code. Right click on the \"Controllers\" folder, and add a new \"Web API 2 Controller - Empty\". Next, call the controller EmployeeController . This will create a new empty controller called EmployeeController . We can add a Get method to the controller, which we'll use to return the level of an Employee. public class EmployeeController : ApiController { public Task<int> Get(long id) { var employee = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(id); return employee.Level; } } Note that the controller is asynchronous, and we can just pass back the Task which the grain returns. Running the Application Now let's test the application. Build the project, and start the local silo. Set the ASP.NET application as the startup project, and run the project. If you navigate to the API URL (the number may be different on your project)... http://localhost:6858/api/employee/3 ...you should see the result returned from the grain: <int xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/\">42</int> That's the basics in place, the rest of the API can be completed by adding the rest of the HTTP verbs. Next Let's look at the steps required to run Orleans on Windows Server: On-Premise Deployment"

    "href": "Tutorials/Declarative-Persistence.html",
    "title": "Declarative Persistence | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Declarative Persistence In the second tutorial, we saw how grain state survived the client being shut down, which opens up for a lot of cache-like scenarios, where Orleans is relied upon as a kind of 'cache with behavior,' an object-oriented cache, if you will. That is already very valuable and goes a long way toward achieving server-side scalability with a simple, familiar, programming model and the built-in single-threaded execution guarantees. However, it is sometimes the case that some of the state you are accumulating belongs in some form of permanent storage, so that it can survive a silo shutdown, or a grain migrating from one silo to another for load-balancing or a complete restart/shutdown of the service. What we have seen so far will not support such situations. Fortunately, Orleans offers a simple declarative model for identifying the state that needs to be stored in a permanent location, while leaving the decision when to save and restore state under programmatic control. You are not required to use the declarative persistence mechanism and can still access storage directly from your grain code, but it’s a nice way to save you some boilerplate code and build applications that are portable across various storage services. Getting Started We'll continue to build on our employee-and-manager sample. The first thing we need to do is make the identities of our workers and managers a little more predictable. In the sample, they were assigned GUIDs using Guid.NewGuid() , which is convenient, but doesn't let us find them in a subsequent run. Therefore, we'll create a set of GUIDs first, then use them as the worker identities. The modified Main program looks like this: static void Main(string[] args) { ... Orleans.GrainClient.Initialize(\"DevTestClientConfiguration.xml\"); var ids = new string[] { \"42783519-d64e-44c9-9c29-399e3afaa625\", \"d694a4e0-1bc3-4c3f-a1ad-ba95103622bc\", \"9a72b0c6-33df-49db-ac05-14316edd332d\", \"6526a751-b9ac-4881-9bfb-836ecce2ca9f\", \"ae4b106f-3c96-464a-b48d-3583ed584b17\", \"b715c40f-d8d2-424d-9618-76afbc0a2a0a\", \"5ad92744-a0b1-487b-a9e7-e6b91e9a9826\", \"e23a55af-217c-4d76-8221-c2b447bf04c8\", \"2eef0ac5-540f-4421-b9a9-79d89400f7ab\" }; var e0 = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(Guid.Parse(ids[0])); var e1 = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(Guid.Parse(ids[1])); var e2 = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(Guid.Parse(ids[2])); var e3 = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(Guid.Parse(ids[3])); var e4 = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(Guid.Parse(ids[4])); var m0 = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IManager>(Guid.Parse(ids[5])); var m1 = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IManager>(Guid.Parse(ids[6])); ... } Next, we'll do some silo configuration, in order to configure the storage provider that will give us access to persistent storage. The silo host project includes a configuration file DevTestServerConfiguration.xml which is where we find the following section: <OrleansConfiguration xmlns=\"urn:orleans\"> <Globals> <StorageProviders> <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.MemoryStorage\" Name=\"MemoryStore\" /> <!-- To use Azure storage, uncomment one of the following elements: --> <!-- <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.AzureTableStorage\" Name=\"AzureStore\" DataConnectionString=\"UseDevelopmentStorage=true\" /> --> <!-- <Provider Type=\"Orleans.Storage.AzureBlobStorage\" Name=\"AzureStore\" DataConnectionString=\"[removed for brevity]\" /> --> </StorageProviders> The MemoryStorage provider is fairly uninteresting, since it doesn't actually provide any permanent storage; it's intended for debugging persistent grains while having no access to a persistent store. In our case, that makes it hard to demonstrate persistence, so we will rely on a real storage provider. Depending on whether you have already set up (and want to use) an Azure storage account, or would like to rely on the Azure storage emulator, you should uncomment one of the other two declarations, but not both. In the case of the former, you have to start the Azure storage emulator after installing the latest version of the Azure SDK. In the case of the latter, you will have to create a Azure storage account and enter the name and keys in the configuration file. With one of those enabled, we're ready to tackle the grain code. Note: The built-in storage provider classes Orleans.Storage.AzureBlobStorage and Orleans.Storage.AzureTableStorage are in the OrleansAzureUtils.dll assembly, make sure this assembly is referenced in your silo worker role project with CopyLocal='True' . Declaring State Identifying that a grain should use persistent state takes three steps: declaring a class for the state, changing the grain base class, and identifying the storage provider. The first step, declaring a state class, simply means identifying the information of an actor that should be persisted and creating what looks like a record of the persistent data -- each state component is represented by a property with a getter and a setter. For employees, we want to persist all the state: public class EmployeeState : GrainState { public int Level { get; set; } public IManager Manager { get; set; } } and for managers, we must store the direct reports, but the _me reference may continue to be created during activation. public class ManagerState : GrainState { public List<IEmployee> Reports { get; set; } } Then, we change the grain class declaration to identify the state interface and remove the variables that we want persisted. Make sure to remove level , and manager from the Employee class and _reports from the Manager class. We also add an attribute to identify the storage provider: [StorageProvider(ProviderName = \"AzureStore\")] public class Employee : Orleans.Grain<EmployeeState>, Interfaces.IEmployee and [StorageProvider(ProviderName=\"AzureStore\")] public class Manager : Orleans.Grain<ManagerState>, IManager At risk of stating the obvious, the name of the storage provider attribute should match the name in the configuration file. This indirection is what allows you to delay choices around where to store grain state until deployment. Given these declarative changes, the grain should no longer rely on a private fields to keep compensation level and manager. Instead, the grain base class gives us access to the state via a State property that is available to the grain. For example: public Task SetManager(IManager manager) { State.Manager = manager; return TaskDone.Done; } Controlling Checkpoints The question that remains is when the persistent state gets saved to the storage provider. One choice that the Orleans designers could have made would be to have the runtime save state after every method invocation, but that turns out to be undesirable because it is far too conservative -- not all invocations will actually modify the state on all invocations, and some will never modify it. Rather than employing a complex system to evaluate state differentials after each method, Orleans asks the grain developer to add the necessary logic to determine whether state needs to be saved or not. Saving the state using the storage provider is easily accomplished by calling base.WriteStateAsync() . Thus, the final version of the Promote() and SetManager() methods looks like this: public Task Promote(int newLevel) { State.Level = newLevel; return base.WriteStateAsync(); } public Task SetManager(IManager manager) { State.Manager = manager; return base.WriteStateAsync(); } In the Manager class, there's only one method that need to be modified to write out data, AddDirectReport() . It should look like this: public async Task AddDirectReport(IEmployee employee) { State.Reports.Add(employee); await employee.SetManager(this); var data = await employee.Greeting( new GreetingData { From = _me, Message = \"Welcome to my team!\" }); Console.WriteLine(\"{0} said: {1}\", data.From.ToString(), data.Message); await base.WriteStateAsync(); } Let's try this out! Set a breakpoint in Employee.Promote() . When we run the client code the first time and hit the breakpoint, the level field should be 0 and the newLevel parameter either 10 or 11 : Let the application finish (reach the 'Hit Enter...' prompt) and exit. Run it again, and compare what happens when you look at state this second time around: Just Making Sure... It's worth checking what Azure thinks about the data. Using a storage explorer such as Azure Storage Explorer (ASE) or the one built in to Server Explorer in Visual Studio 2013, open the storage account (or developer storage of the emulator) and find the 'OrleansGrainState' table. It should look something like this (you have to hit 'Query' in ASE): If everything is working correctly, the grain keys should appear in the PartitionKey column, and the qualified class name of the grains should appear in the RowKey column. Mixing Things A grain may contain a combination of persisted and transient state. Any transient state should be represented by private fields in the grain class. A common use for mixing the two is to cache some computed version of the persisted state in private fields while it is present in memory. For example, a stack of elements may be externally represented as a List<T> , but internally, as a Stack<T> . In the case of our Manager class, the _me field is simply a cached value, something we don't even need to keep as a field in the first place, it can be created any time we need it, but since it's going to be a commonly used value, it's worth keeping it around in a transient field. Next Next, we'll see how we can call our grains from an MVC web application. Front Ends for Orleans Services"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Custom Storage Providers Writing a Custom Storage Provider In the tutorial on declarative actor storage, we looked at allowing grains to store their state in an Azure table using one of the built-in storage providers. While Azure is a great place to squirrel away your data, there are many alternatives. In fact, there are so many that there was no way to support them all. Instead, Orleans is designed to let you easily add support for your own form of storage by writing a storage provider. In this tutorial, we'll walk through how to write a simple file-based storage provider. A file system is not necessarily the best place to store data for grains, since it's so local, but it's an easy example to help us illustrate the principles. Getting Started An Orleans storage provider is simply a class that implements IStorageProvider . It should be built into an assembly that is placed in the Orleans binaries folder. To move it there on build will require adding a bit of post-build event code. We'll start by creating the project -- it should be a regular .NET class library. Once the project is created, let's also rename the file Class1.cs to FileStorageProvider.cs . That should also prompt VS to rename the class we find inside. Next, we must add references to Microsoft.Orleans.Core NuGet package . Assuming, of course, that your project is called StorageProviders , make you silo host project reference it, so that StorageProviders.dll gets copied to the silo folder. Our storage provider should implement the interface Orleans.Storage.IStorageProvider . With a little bit of massaging of the code, it should look something like this: using System; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Orleans; using Orleans.Storage; using Orleans.RuntimeCore; namespace StorageProviders { public class FileStorageProvider : IStorageProvider { public OrleansLogger Log { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public Task Init(string name, Orleans.Providers.IProviderRuntime providerRuntime, Orleans.Providers.IProviderConfiguration config) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } public Task Close() { throw new NotImplementedException(); } public Task ReadStateAsync(string grainType, Orleans.GrainReference grainRef, IGrainState grainState) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } public Task WriteStateAsync(string grainType, Orleans.GrainReference grainRef, IGrainState grainState) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } public Task ClearStateAsync(string grainType, Orleans.GrainReference grainRef, IGrainState grainState) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } } } The first thing we have to figure out is what data we need to provider through configuration. The name is a required property, but we will also need the path to the root directory for our file store. That is, in fact, the only piece of information we need, so we'll add a RootDirectory string property and edit the configuration file as in the previous section. In doing so, it's critical to pay attention to the namespace and class name of the provider. Add this to the <StorageProviders> element in the DevTestServerConfiguration.xml configuration file of your silo host project where you will be testing the provider: <Provider Type=\"StorageProviders.FileStorageProvider\" Name=\"FileStore\" RootDirectory=\".\\Storage\"/> Edit the Grain1.cs file to use this storage provider instead of the Azure provider, then set a breakpoint in the Init() method of the storage provider implementation class and start the silo. If you have followed the instructions, you should hit the breakpoint during silo initialization. There's no reason to go on debugging, since you will throw an exception right away. Initializing the Provider There are four major functions to implement in the provider -- Close() is the only one we won't need to do anything with. As you may have guessed, the starting point is the call to Init() , which provides us with the configuration data and a chance to get things set up properly. In our case, we'll want to set the properties and create the root directory if it doesn't already exist: public Task Init(string name, Orleans.Providers.IProviderRuntime providerRuntime, Orleans.Providers.IProviderConfiguration config) { this.Name = name; if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(config.Properties[\"RootDirectory\"])) throw new ArgumentException(\"RootDirectory property not set\"); var directory = new System.IO.DirectoryInfo(config.Properties[\"RootDirectory\"]); if (!directory.Exists) directory.Create(); this.RootDirectory = directory.FullName; return TaskDone.Done; } Run the program again. This time, you will still crash, but in ReadStateAsync() . After running the code, you should find a Storage directory under the bin\\Debug directory of the silo host project. Make sure you have set the project up to build on F5, or you may not see the edits take effect. Reading State To store data in the file system (or anywhere, really), we have to devise a convention that generates a unique name for each grain. This is easiest done by combining the state type name with the grain id, which combines the grain type and GUID creating a globally unique key. Thus, ReadStateAsync() (which, by the way, should be declared as an async method), starts like this: var collectionName = grainState.GetType().Name; var key = grainRef.ToKeyString(); var fName = key + \".\" + collectionName; var path = System.IO.Path.Combine(RootDirectory, fName); var fileInfo = new System.IO.FileInfo(path); if (!fileInfo.Exists) return; We also need to decide how the data will be stored. To make it easy to inspect the data outside of the application, we're going to use JSON. A more space-conscious design may use a binary serialization format, instead, it's entirely a choice of the provider designer's. The JSON serializer is found in the System.Web.Extensions assembly, which you now need to add to the project's references. Also, add a using clause to the top of the file: using System.Web.Script.Serialization; using (var stream = fileInfo.OpenText()) { var storedData = await stream.ReadToEndAsync(); JavaScriptSerializer deserializer = new JavaScriptSerializer(); object data = deserializer.Deserialize(storedData, grainState.GetType()); var dict = ((IGrainState)data).AsDictionary(); grainState.SetAll(dict); } Writing State The format decisions have already been made, so coding up the WriteStateAsync method should be straight-forward: serialize as JSON, construct the file name, then write to the file: public async Task WriteStateAsync(string grainType, Orleans.GrainReference grainRef, IGrainState grainState) { Dictionary<string, object> dataValues = grainState.AsDictionary(); JavaScriptSerializer serializer = new JavaScriptSerializer(); var storedData = serializer.Serialize(dataValues); var collectionName = grainState.GetType().Name; var key = grainRef.ToKeyString(); var fName = key + \".\" + collectionName; var path = System.IO.Path.Combine(RootDirectory, fName); var fileInfo = new System.IO.FileInfo(path); using (var stream = new System.IO.StreamWriter( fileInfo.Open(System.IO.FileMode.Create, System.IO.FileAccess.Write))) { await stream.WriteAsync(storedData); } } Putting it Together There's really just one thing left to do, and that is to test the thing. Run the application and let it get to the end, where the greetings are shown, and then terminate it. Under the bin\\Debug\\Storage directory of your silo host project, you should find a file called 0.Grain1State , and it should contain something very recognizable: Run the application again, and you should see the same behaviour as before, that is, the last greeting of the first session is remembered. Clearing State The easiest method to write is the one that deletes grain state, which we didn't see any use of in the previous tutorial. In fact, we don't need it for our Hello World application, so we'll just leave its implementation as an exercise. It should do the obvious, i.e. delete the file. Next We'll look at how you can unit test grains: Unit Testing Grains"

    "title": "Concurrency | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Concurrency Please read about Grains before following this tutorial. Let's go back to the code that was established in the tutorial on collections of actors and modify it to demonstrate how things can go bad by creating a trivial cycle in the messaging graph: when an employee receives a greeting, he sends another greeting back to the sender and waits for the acknowledgment. This will send a back-and-forth series of messages, until we get to 3. First create a class in the interface project which we'll use to send the greetings around: public class GreetingData { public long From { get; set; } public string Message { get; set; } public int Count { get; set; } } From will be the sender of the message (the ID of the grain), Message will be the message text, and Count will be the number of times the message has been sent back and forth. This stops us from getting a stack overflow. We need to modify the arguments of Greeting on the IEmployee interface to : Task Greeting(GreetingData data); We need to update the implementation accordingly: public async Task Greeting(GreetingData data) { Console.WriteLine(\"{0} said: {1}\", data.From, data.Message); // stop this from repeating endlessly if (data.Count >= 3) return; // send a message back to the sender var fromGrain = GrainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(data.From); await fromGrain.Greeting(new GreetingData { From = this.GetPrimaryKeyLong(), Message = \"Thanks!\", Count = data.Count + 1 }); } We'll also update the Manager class, so it send the new message object: public async Task AddDirectReport(IEmployee employee) { _reports.Add(employee); await employee.SetManager(this); await employee.Greeting(new GreetingData { From = this.GetPrimaryKeyLong(), Message = \"Welcome to my team!\" }); } Now the Employee sends a message back to the manager, saying \"Thanks!\". Let's add some simple client code to add a direct report to a manager: var e0 = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(0); var m1 = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IManager>(1); m1.AddDirectReport(e0); When we run this code, the first \"Thanks!\" greeting is received. However, when this message is responded to this we get a 30 second pause, then warnings appear in the log and we're told the grain is about to break it's promise. 1 said: Welcome to my team! 0 said: Thanks!

Grain 0 sends a message to grain 1. In that call grain 1 sends a message back to grain 0. However, grain 0 can't process it because it's awaiting the first message, so it gets queued. The await can't complete until the second message is returned, so we've entered a state that we can't escape from. Orleans waits for 30 seconds, then kills the request. Orleans offers us a way to deal with this, by marking the grain [Reentrant] , which means that additional calls may be made while the grain is waiting for a task to complete, resulting in interleaved execution. [Reentrant] public class Employee : Orleans.Grain, Interfaces.IEmployee { ... } We see that the sample works, and Orleans is able to interleave the grain calls: 1 said: Welcome to my team! 0 said: Thanks! 1 said: Thanks! 0 said: Thanks! Messages Messages are simply data passed from one actor to another, we just created the GreetingData class to do just this. In .NET, most objects are created from a class of some sort and are passed around by reference, something that doesn't work well with concurrency, and definitely not with distribution. When Orleans sends a message from one grain to another, it creates a deep copy of the object, and provides the copy to the second grain, and not the object stored in the first grain. This prohibits the mutation of state from one grain to another, one of the main tenants in the actor model is that state shouldn't be shared, and message passing is the only mechanism for exchanging data. When the grains are in different silos, the object model is serialized to a binary format, and sent over the wire. However, this deep copy process is expensive, and if you promise not to modify the message, then for communication with grains within a silo, it's unnecessary. If you indicate to Orleans that you are not going to modify the object (i.e. it's immutable) then it can skip the deep copy step, and it will pass the object by reference. There's no way Orleans or C# can stop you from modifying the state, you have to be disciplined. Immutability is indicated with a the [Immutable] attribute on the class: [Immutable] public class GreetingData { public long From { get; set; } public string Message { get; set; } public int Count { get; set; } } No other code change is required, this is just a signal to give to Orleans to tell it your not going to modify this object. Next Next, we'll see how we can interact with external services from inside our grain. Interaction with Libraries and Services"

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Cloud Deployment Deploying Orleans to Windows Azure This walkthrough shows the steps required to deploy the sample created in the Front Ends for Orleans Services to Windows Azure Cloud Services. In Azure, one or more worker roles will be used to host the Orleans silos, and an Azure web role will act as the presentation layer for the application and client to the application grains running in the Orleans silos. The same grain interfaces and implementation can run on both Windows Server and Windows Azure, so no special considerations are needed in order to be able to run your application in a Windows Azure hosting environment. The Azure Web Sample sample app provides a working example of how to run a web application with supporting Orleans silo cluster backend in an Azure hosted service, and the details are described below. Pre-requisites The following prerequisites are required: Visual Studio 2013 or 2015 Windows Azure SDK v2.4 or higher For more info on installing and working with Windows Azure in general, see the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) web site: ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsazure/ ) Create Azure Worker Role for Orleans Silos Right click on your solution, and select 'Add | New Project...'. Choose the 'Windows Azure Cloud Service' project template: When prompted, select a new 'Worker Role' to add to the project. This will be used to host the Orleans Silos: Add project references for Orleans Silo binaries Add references to the OrleansAzureSilo project for the required Orleans server library files. Copies of these files can be found in the .\\Binaries\\OrleansServer folder under the Orleans SDK. Orleans.dll OrleansAzureUtils.dll OrleansRuntime.dll OrleansProviders.dll (Only required if you your grains use the Declarative Persistence functionality.) Note: All of these references MUST have Copy Local = 'True' settings to ensure the necessary library DLLs get copied into the OrleansAzureSilo project output directory. Configure Azure Worker Role for Orleans Silos The Worker Role initialization class is a normal Azure worker role - it needs to inherit from the usual Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime.RoleEntryPoint base class. The worker role initialization class needs to create an instance of Orleans.Host.Azure.OrleansAzureSilo class, and call the appropriate Start / Run / Stop functions in the appropriate places: public class WorkerRole : RoleEntryPoint { Orleans.Runtime.Host.AzureSilo silo; public override bool OnStart() { // Do other silo initialization – for example: Azure diagnostics, etc return base.OnStart(); } public override void OnStop() { silo.Stop(); base.Stop(); } public override void Run() { var config = new ClusterConfiguration(); config.StandardLoad(); // Configure storage providers silo = new AzureSilo(); bool ok = silo.Start(RoleEnvironment.DeploymentId, RoleEnvironment.CurrentRoleInstance, config); silo.Run(); // Call will block until silo is shutdown } } It is IMPORTANT to start the silo not in OnStart but in Run. Azure may not have the firewalls open yet (on the remote silos) at the OnStart phase. Then, in the ServiceDefinition.csdef file for this role, add some required configuration items used by the Orleans Azure hosting library to the WorkerRole configuration: Add a ConfigurationSettings declaration named 'DataConnectionString'. This is the Azure storage location where Orleans Azure hosting library will place / look for its silo instance table. Add an InternalEndpoint declaration for a TCP endpoint named 'OrleansSiloEndpoint' Add an InternalEndpoint declaration for a TCP endpoint named 'OrleansProxyEndpoint' <ServiceDefinition ...> <WorkerRole name=\"OrleansAzureSilos\" ...> ... <ConfigurationSettings> <Setting name=\"DataConnectionString\" /> </ConfigurationSettings> <Endpoints> <InternalEndpoint name=\"OrleansSiloEndpoint\" protocol=\"tcp\" port=\"11111\" /> <InternalEndpoint name=\"OrleansProxyEndpoint\" protocol=\"tcp\" port=\"30000\" /> </Endpoints> ... </WorkerRole> ... </ServiceDefinition> In the ServiceConfiguration.cscfg file for this role, add some required configuration items used by the Orleans Azure hosting library: Add a ConfigurationSettings definition for 'DataConnectionString' This will be a normal Azure storage connection – either for the development storage emulator (only valid if running locally), or a full Azure storage account connection string for cloud-storage. In general, this connection string is likely to use the same configuration values as the Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString diagnostics connection string setting, but is not required to. See the Configure Azure Storage Connection Strings for more information. For example, to use local Developer Storage emulator (for local testing only) <ConfigurationSettings> <Setting name=\"DataConnectionString\" value=\"UseDevelopmentStorage=true\" /> </ConfigurationSettings> Or using an Azure cloud storage account: <ConfigurationSettings> <Setting name=\"DataConnectionString\" value=\"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=MyAccount;AccountKey=MyKey\" /> </ConfigurationSettings> Changing DataConnectionString The \"DataConnectionString\" setting in ServiceDefinition.csdef is the default name use by the Orleans silo for the Azure table account connection string that will be used for Orleans system tables such as OrleanSiloInstances . If you wish to use a different setting name for this value, then in the silo role initialization code set the property OrleansAzureSilo.DataConnectionConfigurationSettingName before the call to OrleansAzureSilo.Start(...) Add your Orleans silo config file to Azure Worker Role for Orleans Silos. Add an OrleansConfiguration.xml file into your OrleansAzureSilo worker role project, along with any supporting libraries those grains need. The networking configuration information in OrleansConfiguration.xml will be overridden by values from the Azure role environment / configuration. Note: You MUST ensure this config file get copied into the OrleansAzureSilo project output directory, to ensure they get picked up by the Azure packaging tools. Add your grain binaries to Azure Worker Role for Orleans Silos Add the grain interfaces DLL and implementation classes DLL for the grains to he hosted in the Azure silo into the OrleansAzureSilo project, along with any supporting libraries those grains need. Note: You MUST ensure that all the referenced binaries are copied into the OrleansAzureSilo project output directory, to ensure they get picked up by the Azure packaging tools. Running Orleans Client as Azure Web Role The user interface / presentation layer for your application will usually run as a Web Role in Azure. The Orleans.Host.Azure.Client.OrleansAzureClient utility class is the main mechanism for bootstrapping connection to the Orleans silo worker roles from an Azure Web Role. A few additional configuration steps are needed to make the OrleansAzureClient utility class work – see below for details. Create Azure Web Role for Orleans Client Using the Azure Tools for Visual Studio, create a normal Azure web role project. Any type of web role can be used as an Orleans client, and there are no specific naming requirements or conventions for this project. Add a web role to the solution: Add project references for Orleans Client binaries. Add references to the web role project for the required Orleans client library files. Copies of these files can be found in either SDK-ROOT\\Samples\\References or SDK-ROOT\\Binaries\\OrleansClient directories. Orleans.dll OrleansAzureUtils.dll Note: All of these references MUST have Copy Local = 'True' settings to ensure the necessary library DLLs get copied into the web role project output directory. Configure Azure Web Role to be an Orleans Client In the ServiceDefinition.csdef file for this web role, add some required configuration items used by the Orleans Azure hosting library: Add a ConfigurationSettings declaration named 'DataConnectionString'. This is the Azure storage location where Orleans Azure hosting library will place / look for its silo instance table. In addition, a http/s InputEndpoint will also need to be declared, just as for any other Azure web role config. <ServiceDefinition ...> <WebRole name=\"MyWebRole\" ...> ... <ConfigurationSettings: <Setting name=\"DataConnectionString\" /: </ConfigurationSettings> <Sites> <Site name=\"Web\"> <Bindings> <Binding name=\"Endpoint1\" endpointName=\"Endpoint1\" /> </Bindings> </Site> </Sites> <Endpoints> <InputEndpoint name=\"Endpoint1\" protocol=\"http\" port=\"80\" /> </Endpoints> ... </WebRole> ... </ServiceDefinition> In the ServiceConfiguration.cscfg file for this role, add some required configuration items used by the Orleans Azure hosting library: Add a ConfigurationSettings definition for 'DataConnectionString'. This will be a normal Azure storage connection – either for the development storage emulator (if running locally), or a full Azure storage account connection string for cloud-storage. This setting MUST match the DataConnectionString value used by the OrleansSiloWorker role in order for the client to discover and bootstrap the connection to the Orleans silos. For example, to use local Developer Storage emulator (for local testing only) <ServiceConfiguration ...> <Role name=\"OrleansWebClient\" ...> ... <ConfigurationSettings> <Setting name=\"DataConnectionString\" value=\"UseDevelopmentStorage=true\" /> </ConfigurationSettings> ... </Role> ... </ServiceConfiguration> Or using an Azure cloud storage account: <ServiceConfiguration ...> <Role name=\"OrleansWebClient\" ...> ... <ConfigurationSettings> <Setting name=\"DataConnectionString> value=\"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=MyAccount;AccountKey=MyKey\" /> </ConfigurationSettings> ... </Role> ... </ServiceConfiguration> Add your Orleans client config file to Azure Web Role for Orleans Client. Add a ClientConfiguration.xml file into this project. The networking configuration information in ClientConfiguration.xml will be overridden by values from the Azure role environment / configuration. Note: You MUST ensure this config file get copied into the web role project output directory, to ensure they get picked up by the Azure packaging tools. Add your grain interface binaries to Azure Web Role for Orleans Client Add the grain interfaces DLL for the application grains into this web role project. Access to the DLL containing the grain implementation classes should not be required by the client web role. Note: You MUST ensure that all the referenced binaries for grain interfaces and the generated proxy / factory libraries are copied into the web role project output directory, to ensure they get picked up by the Azure packaging tools. The grain implementation DLLs should not be required by the client and so should not be referenced by the web role. Initialize Client Connection to Orleans Silos It is recommended to bootstrap and initialize the client connection to the Orleans silo worker roles, to ensure a connection is set up before use – either in the Page_Load method for each .aspx page, or in Global.asax initialization methods. protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (Page.IsPostBack) { if (!OrleansAzureClient.IsInitialized) { OrleansAzureClient.Initialize(); } } } Repeated calls to OrleansAzureClient.Initialize() will return and do nothing if the Orleans client connection is already set up. An additional variant of OrleansAzureClient.Initialize(System.IO.FileInfo) allows a base client config file location to be specified explicitly. The internal endpoint addresses of the Orleans silo nodes will still be determined dynamically from the Orleans Silo instance table each silo node registers with. <!--TODO: Create link to Orleans API when the link is created/found--> See the Orleans API docs for details of the various Initialize methods available. Deploying to Azure The normal Azure deployment tools are used to deploy the application to Windows Azure – either into the local Azure Compute Emulator for local development / test (Press F5 to run), or into the Azure cloud hosting environment right click on the Cloud project and select 'Publish': Next We'll write our own storage provider, to save grain state to alternative to file instead of Microsoft Azure: Custom Storage Providers"

    "title": "Actor Identity | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Actor Identity In object-oriented environments, the identity of an object is hard to distinguish from a reference to it. Thus, when an object is created using new, the reference you get back represents all aspects of its identity except those that map the object to some external entity that it represents. In distributed systems, object references cannot represent instance identity, since references are typically limited to a single address space. That is certainly the case for .NET references. Furthermore, a virtual actor must have an identity regardless of whether it is active, so that we can activate it on demand. Therefore grains have a primary key. The primary key can be either a GUID (A Globally Unique Identifier), a long integer, or a string. The primary key is scoped to the grain type. Therefore, the complete identity of a grain is formed from the actor type and its key. The caller of the grain decides a long, a GUID, or a string scheme should be used. In fact the underlying data is the same, so the schemes can be used interchangeably. When a long is used, a GUID is actually created, and padded with zeros. Situations that require a singleton grain instance, such as a dictionary or registry, benefit from using 0 (a valid GUID) as its key. This is merely a convention, but by adhering, it becomes clear at the call site that it is what is going on, as we saw in the first tutorial: Using GUIDs GUIDs are useful when there are several processes that could request a grain, such as a number of web servers in a web farm. You don't need to coordinate the allocation of keys, which could introduce a single point of failure in the system, or a system-side lock on a resource which could present a bottleneck. There is a very low chance of GUIDs colliding, so they would probably be the default choice when architecting an Orleans system. Referencing a grain by GUID in client code: var grain = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IExample>(Guid.NewGuid()); Retrieving the primary key from grain code: public override Task OnActivateAsync() { Guid primaryKey = this.GetPrimaryKey(); return base.OnActivateAsync(); } Using Longs A long integer is also available, which would make sense if the grain is persisted to a relational database, where numerical indexes are preferred over GUIDs. Referencing a grain by long integer in client code: var grain = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IExample>(1); Retrieving the primary key form grain code: public override Task OnActivateAsync() { long primaryKey = this.GetPrimaryKeyLong(); return base.OnActivateAsync(); } Using Strings A string is also available. Referencing a grain by String in client code: var grain = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IExample>(\"myGrainKey\"); Retrieving the primary key form grain code: public override Task OnActivateAsync() { string primaryKey = this.GetPrimaryKeyString(); return base.OnActivateAsync(); } The stock ticker example used in the Interaction with Libraries and Services uses a string keys to activate grains representing different stock symbols. Using Compound Primary Key If you have a system that doesn't fit well with either GUIDs or longs, you can opt for a compound primary key which allows you to use a combination of a GUID or long and a string to reference a grain. You can inherit your interface from 'IGrainWithGuidCompoundKey' or 'IGrainWithIntegerCompoundKey\" interface like this: public interface IExampleGrain : Orleans.IGrainWithIntegerCompoundKey { Task Hello(); } In client code, this adds a second argument to the GetGrain method on the grain factory. var grain = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IExample>(0, \"a string!\"); To access the compound key in the grain, we can call an overload on the GetPrimaryKey method: public class ExampleGrain : Orleans.Grain, IExampleGrain { public Task Hello() { string keyExtension; long primaryKey = this.GetPrimaryKey(out keyExtension); Console.WriteLine(\"Hello from \" + keyExtension); return TaskDone.Done; } } Next Let's add another type of grain into the solution, and demonstrate inter-grain communication.

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc A Service is a Collection of Communicating Actors The previous tutorials all relied on interacting with a single actor from the client. In most real-world situations this is not what would be expected as actors are intended to be more or less as light-weight as objects and treated as such. Thus, you would no more find an application with just one actor type and one actor instance than you would expect to find a .NET application with one instance of one class. In this tutorial, we're going to construct multiple actors from a couple of classes with different communication interfaces. Not everything will be explained while putting together the application, we will go back and elaborate on a few things after we have it working. Employees and Managers This example will use the relationship of employees and managers to demonstrate the concept of multiple actors - it's one we all understand and relate to. Start by creating a new solution with a silo host, a communications interface project and a grain implementation project as described in previous tutorials. Don't forget to add the necessary project-to-project references and make sure to add a build dependency on the implementation project so that it is built when the host project is built. Change the first interface to IEmployee and add an interface called IManager . Add a couple of methods to describe relationships and employment level: public interface IEmployee : IGrainWithGuidKey { Task<int> GetLevel(); Task Promote(int newLevel); Task<IManager> GetManager(); Task SetManager(IManager manager); } and public interface IManager : IGrainWithGuidKey { Task<IEmployee> AsEmployee(); Task<List<IEmployee>> GetDirectReports(); Task AddDirectReport(IEmployee employee); } Note that this looks a bit different to normal .NET interfaces: usually, you have a property with a setter and a getter, but when defining grain interfaces, you need to avoid using properties altogether, only methods are supported. This is because .NET property setters and getters aren't meant to do I/O. It is often possible to use traditional object-oriented design methodology with Orleans, but sometimes there are reasons for not doing so. In this case, we're choosing to not rely on inheritance when defining the Manager class, even though a Manager is clearly also an Employee . The reason for this will be explained when we discuss Orleans' support for Declarative Persistence . With these two interfaces as our starting point, the implementation classes are straight-forward to implement, as the interfaces are simple. Here's what it looks like: public class Employee : Grain, Interfaces.IEmployee { public Task<int> GetLevel() { return Task.FromResult(_level); } public Task Promote(int newLevel) { _level = newLevel; return TaskDone.Done; } public Task<IManager> GetManager() { return Task.FromResult(_manager); } public Task SetManager(IManager manager) { _manager = manager; return TaskDone.Done; } private int _level; private IManager _manager; } and public class Manager : Grain, IManager { public override Task OnActivateAsync() { _me = this.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(this.GetPrimaryKey()); return base.OnActivateAsync(); } public Task<List<IEmployee>> GetDirectReports() { return Task.FromResult(_reports); } public Task AddDirectReport(IEmployee employee) { _reports.Add(employee); employee.SetManager(this); return TaskDone.Done; } public Task<IEmployee> AsEmployee() { return Task.FromResult(_me); } private IEmployee _me; private List<IEmployee> _reports = new List<IEmployee>(); } A manager is expressed as an employee through composition: the manager grain has a reference to an grain representing its \"employeeness.\" The role of OnActivateAsync() will be explained later on; for now, you may consider it a constructor. In the client (Program.cs) , we can add a few lines to create a couple of employees and their manager: Orleans.GrainClient.Initialize(\"DevTestClientConfiguration.xml\"); var grainFactory = GrainClient.GrainFactory; var e0 = grainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(Guid.NewGuid()); var e1 = grainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(Guid.NewGuid()); var e2 = grainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(Guid.NewGuid()); var e3 = grainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(Guid.NewGuid()); var e4 = grainFactory.GetGrain<IEmployee>(Guid.NewGuid()); var m0 = grainFactory.GetGrain<IManager>(Guid.NewGuid()); var m1 = grainFactory.GetGrain<IManager>(Guid.NewGuid()); var m0e = m0.AsEmployee().Result; var m1e = m1.AsEmployee().Result; m0e.Promote(10); m1e.Promote(11); m0.AddDirectReport(e0).Wait(); m0.AddDirectReport(e1).Wait(); m0.AddDirectReport(e2).Wait(); m1.AddDirectReport(m0e).Wait(); m1.AddDirectReport(e3).Wait(); m1.AddDirectReport(e4).Wait(); Console.WriteLine(\"Orleans Silo is running.\\nPress Enter to terminate...\"); Console.ReadLine(); In the code we have seen so far, it is noteworthy that you can send grain references (interfaces) in messages. Thus, when a direct report is added to a manager, the manager can communicate directly with the employee without calling GetGrain() . This ability is essential in making the programming model a smooth transition from .NET. Let's add the ability for employees to send messages to each other: public interface IEmployee : IGrainWithGuidKey { ... Task Greeting(IEmployee from, string message); ... } then: public class Employee : Grain, Interfaces.IEmployee { public Task Greeting(IEmployee from, string message) { Console.WriteLine(\"{0} said: {1}\", from.GetPrimaryKey().ToString(), message); return TaskDone.Done; } and public class Manager : Employee, IManager { public Task AddDirectReport(IEmployee employee) { _reports.Add(employee); employee.SetManager(this); employee.Greeting(_me, \"Welcome to my team!\"); return TaskDone.Done; } Executing it, you should see something like this: The use of a GUID to represent the name of a person leaves something for you to fix, as an exercise. TaskDone.Done , used in the code above, is a convenience object defined by Orleans to allow code to succinctly return an already completed Task . Asynchrony Bites Us! In the image above, you may notice that the last message comes out after the request to press Enter -- why is that? All the client requests to add a direct report dutifully wait for the addition to finish, i.e. they are fully synchronous. The problem lies elsewhere -- in the implementation of AddDirectReport() , which doesn't wait for the greeting to be acknowledged. Such concurrency is often innocuous and sometimes beneficial, as long as we don't consider the risk of exceptions, which we always must. A correct version of the method would look like this: public async Task AddDirectReport(IEmployee employee) { _reports.Add(employee); await employee.SetManager(this); await employee.Greeting(_me, \"Welcome to my team!\"); } The Life of an Actor Orleans actors are virtual, meaning that even though an actor logically exists, it may not be present in memory at a given point in time. In fact, Orleans takes this concept to an extreme by claiming that all actors exist at all time (past and present) and are never created or destroyed. An actor may be inactive, such as before the first time anyone refers to it or after the last use, but is never not existing. While counter-intuitive and, frankly, strange to most of us with a object-oriented background, this notion actually removes a source of complexity from the system. An actor is either active (present in memory) or inactive, and that status can not be observed by a client. Actor activation is on-demand, just like virtual memory is mapped on demand to physical memory. Thus, the .NET object that holds the actor state is logically just a copy of the actor in memory while it is in the active state. Implementations of Orleans grains should refrain from having constructors, even parameter-less ones, with any logic. That is simply the wrong way of thinking about them: grains are never created or destroyed, just moved from the inactive to the active state or vice versa. Therefore, the implementation should catch the activation event (a call to OnActivateAsync() ) and perform any initialization steps necessary there. It is guaranteed to be called before any method on the grain instance is called. In the Manager grain above, it was used to establish the reference to the Employee grain. There is also an OnDeactivateAsync() method, used more infrequently. Next Next up is a look at Concurrency in Orleans."

    "title": "Twitter Sentiment | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc The Twitter Sentiment application records Twitter sentiment by consuming the Twitter streaming API, calulates a sentiment score for each tweet (i.e. is it a positive/negative/neutral tone of lanuage), and then records that sentiment against each hashtag in the tweet using an Orleans grain to maintain a total score for each unique hashtag. The sample illustrates using Orleans to manipulate data with high volumes of input traffic, where each grain owns a row in a table (or a key in a key/value store, or a document in a document store) and all updates go through one single grain, reducing contention for individual rows, keys, or documents. Client The sentiment processing on each tweet is performed in a Node.js application, in server.js, and uses the sentiment library to perform the analysis, which uses key words to determine sentiment. The sentiment score and the actual tweet are posted to the ASP.NET MVC program for processing. The ASP.NET MVC application serves two main roles. It acts as the end point to post sentiment scores into Orleans, and it provides the UI to view hashtag sentiment scores from Orleans. When updating a sentiment score, the SetScore function in GrainContoller.cs gets a handle for a stateless TweetDispatcher grain, and calls its AddScore method. The GetScores method retrieves the score for an arbitrary list of hashtags, each score being expressed as a combination of the overall positive sentiment score, the overall negative sentiment score, and the total number of tweets tracked containing that hashtag. Recall that some sentiment analysis will often result in a neutral weighting, so it is good to track the total number of tweets containing the hashtag. The controller also retrieves a count of the total number of hashtags that the system is tracking, to help give a sense of the scale of data coming in from the Twitter fire hose. Orleans There are three main Orleans grains in the sample. The TweetDispatcher is the public “endpoint” for sentiment analysis. [StatelessWorker] public interface ITweetDispatcherGrain : Orleans.IGrain { Task AddScore(int score, string[] hashtags, string tweet); Task<Totals[]> GetTotals(string[] hashtags); } Note that it is a stateless grain, and its main role is to pass the work to stateful grains for processing. AddScore takes a tweet, and parses out each hashtag for processing by the appropriate grain. GetTotals retrieves get the number of tweets that have included a specific list of hashtags. This grain exists in part to support the “batch processing” of several hashtags within a single tweet. One Orleans grain is created for each unique hashtag, and this grain is used to track the current sentiment score. [ExtendedPrimaryKey] public interface IHashtagGrain : Orleans.IGrain { Task AddScore(int score, string lastTweet); Task<Totals> GetTotals(); } Note that the ExtendedPrimaryKey attribute indicates that a string, in this case the twitter hashtag, is being used as a composite key for the grain, instead of the more usual Guid or long, which is a more natural fit for grains that have strings rather than numeric keys. The AddMethod updates the current state with the latest sentiment score, and GetTotals returns a Totals structure, with the breakdown of the sentiment analysis, along with the date stamp for the last processed tweet, and the test of the last tweet. The last tweet is kept just to allow the UI to display it, to help give the sentiment more context. When first activated, the grain tracks this activation by calling the IncrementCounter method on a Counter grain. public interface ICounter : Orleans.IGrain { Task IncrementCounter(); Task ResetCounter(); Task<int> GetTotalCounter(); } To increase performance, the counter grain only persists its internal state periodically, in this case, every 100 calls. The running total does not have to be one hundred percent accurate, so if the data were lost due to a silo failure between updates, that would not be critical. If this grain were to be called repeatedly from other grains, it could become a bottleneck, and some form of aggregation pattern would be needed, but as its only called once from each grain, upon grain initialization, this should not be an issue. Prerequisites The following must be installed prior to running the sample: Visual Studio 2013 Orleans SDK Node.js Tools for Visual Studio . Make sure to read the instructions and also install Node.js, not just the VS tools! A Windows Azure storage account A Twitter account and Twitter application development credentials. Sign up as a Twitter Developer and create an application. Make a note of the 'API key', 'API secret', 'Access token' and 'Access secret'. It is important to set the application permissions to include all rights, and then regenerating the keys and tokens before using them. If you don't, the client will silently fail. Running the Sample Open the OrleansTwitterDemo.sln file in Visual Studio 2013, and build the solution. Enter the details from Twitter into the TwitterClient\\app.js file. Start Azure Storage Emulator or replace \"UseDevelopmentStorage=true\" in DevTestServerConfiguration.xml in the Host project with your Azure Storage account Start the local Orleans Silo by running the Host project. Start the TwitterClient project. The Twitter Client should start, showing you every tweet it is consuming. Start the TwitterWebApplication project. Your browser should open on http://localhost:5190/ showing you a few preset hashtags you can monitor. Try adding a couple of hashtags to track using the browser UI. Got get a cup of coffee or do something else for a while, because it may take some time before the tags you care about are seen in the feed."

    "title": "Tic Tac Toe | Microsoft Orleans Website",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc TicTacToe is based on the classic board game, also known as \"noughts and crosses.\" Its game logic is simple, which makes it an excellent sample for showing how a turn-based game could be easily implemented in Orleans. A game like this may not at first sight seem a natural fit for Orleans, if you only think about it in terms of a single player game. However, within a social game context, such as a Facebook game, where thousands of players could be playing dozens of games at any one time - some games waiting for the opponent to join, others mid game, waiting for the next move to play out, then it is a much more natural fit. Orleans enables the developer to concentrate on expressing game logic as grains, letting the runtime handle the scale. This sample also demonstrates how an Orleans application can be deployed to Windows Azure. Running the Sample The sample comes complete with a Windows Azure project, so it can be run locally in the Windows Azure local emulator, or deployed as a real cloud service. If running locally, you will need to create multiple \"private\" browsing sessions, to ensure each browser session is recognized as a new player. To run locally without the emulator: Open the TicTacToe.sln file in Visual Studio and build the solution. Set the TicTacToe.Grains project as the startup project. Press F5 to start the application. Start the TicTacToe.Web project manually using the Project context menu -> Debug -> Start new instance Your browser should open, asking you to enter your name. To run locally using the Azure emulator: Open the TicTacToe.sln file in Visual Studio and build the solution. Set the TicTacToe.Azure project as the startup project. Start the Azure Compute Emulator if necessary. Press F5 to start the application. Your browser should open, asking you to enter your name. To run in Windows Azure: Open the TicTacToe.sln file in Visual Studio and build the solution. Expand the TicTacToe.Azure project, and in the Roles folder, open the properties for TicTacToe.Web and TicTacToe.WorkerRole . Set the value for the DataConnectionString setting for both roles to a Windows Azure Storage Account. Right click on the TicTacToe.Azure project, and click Publish . Follow the instructions in the wizard to deploy the application on Azure. The application will deploy, and you will be able to access on http://YOURCLOUDSERVICE.cloudapp.net/ How it works There are two main grain types in OrleansXO, one represents a player, the other representing a game. User Grain A PlayerGrain is activated for each player logging in to the system. A GUID is used to uniquely identify the user, which is stored in a cookie by the MVC web application. The IPlayer interface defines the operations a player can perform: public interface IPlayer : IGrain { Task<List<GameSummary>> GetGameSummaries(); Task<Guid> CreateGame(); Task<GameState> JoinGame(Guid gameId); Task LeaveGame(Guid gameId, GameOutcome outcome); Task SetUsername(string username); Task<string> GetUsername(); } The player grain handles the creating of new games (so another player can then join), leaving a game (once it is over), and tracking the progress of all active games. Game Grain Each game is also represented by a GameGrain . They are also uniquely identify using a GUID. public interface IGame : Orleans.IGrain { Task<GameState> AddPlayerToGame(Guid player); Task<GameState> GetState(); Task<List<GameMove>> GetMoves(); Task<GameState> MakeMove(GameMove move); Task<GameSummary> GetSummary(Guid player); Task SetName(string name); } Once a user grain creates a game, that user is automatically added as one of the players. Once a game is joined by a second player, the game can start. The players make their turns until the game ends with either a draw or a winner. The GameGrain maintains the state of the game, the players in the game, whose turn it is next, and whether the game is in play or finished. The MakeMove method handles the game logic, checking the validity of a move and, once played, checks if that move ends the game. In the case of the game ending, the player grains are informed of the outcome via the LeaveGame call. The game was designed with social gaming in mind, so the main mechanism for inviting other players is an \"out of band\" from the game, and would probably be an invite to a friend, sending the GUID that represents the game. As an optimization purely for testing, a pairing grain was created that uses MemoryCache to hold a the list of games that are available to join, with an expiry of one hour, to stop \"stale\" games appearing on the list. An ASP.NET MVC application serves an HTML page. JavaScript running in the browser polls the web server, and retrieve JSON data, which it renders using Handlebars templates ."
