# Streaming samples

This folder contains two samples demonstrating Orleans Streams.

The first sample, in the `Simple` folder, demonstrates pub/sub using Azure Event Hub and an implicit consumer.

The second sample, in the `CustomDataAdapter` folder, demonstrates how to configure a custom data adapter so that Orleans can consume stream messages which did not originate from Orleans.
