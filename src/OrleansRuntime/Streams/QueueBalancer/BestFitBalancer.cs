    /// Best fit balancer keeps each active bucket responsible for its ideal set of resources, and redistributes 
    /// resources from inactive buckets evenly over active buckets.  If there are large numbers of inactive buckets,
    /// this can lead to quite a bit of shuffling of resources from inactive buckets as buckets come back online.
    /// Requirements:
    /// - Even distribution of resources across buckets
    /// - Must be consistent results for same inputs regardless of input order.
    /// - Minimize movement of resources when rebalancing from changes in active buckets.
    /// - Must be deterministic independent of previous distribution state.
    /// Algorithm:
    /// - On creation generate an ideal distribution of resources across all buckets, that is, each bucket has no more than 1 resource more
    ///    than any other bucket.
    /// - When requesting new resource distribution for a list of active buckets:
    ///     1) Initialize the new distribution of each active bucket with the ideal resources for that bucket.  This prevents
    ///        these resources from ever being assigned to another bucket unless a bucket becomes inactive.
    ///     2) Build a list of inactive buckets.
    ///     3) For each inactive bucket, add its ideal resource allocation to the list of resources to be reallocated.
    ///     4) Order the active buckets by the number of resources allocated to each and begin assigning them more resources 
    ///        from the list of resources to be reallocated.
    ///         i) Continue iterating over the active buckets assigning resources until there are no more resources that need
    ///            reallocated.
