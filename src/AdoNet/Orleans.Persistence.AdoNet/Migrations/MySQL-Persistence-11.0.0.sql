    -- be only one grain with the given ID and type combination only. This
    -- grain saves states mostly serially if Orleans guarantees are upheld. Even
    -- if not, the updates should work correctly due to version number.

    -- In split brain situations there can be a situation where there are two or more
    -- grains with the given ID and type combination. When they try to INSERT
    -- concurrently, the table needs to be locked pessimistically before one of
    -- the grains gets @GrainStateVersion = 1 in return and the other grains will fail
    -- to update storage. The following arrangement is made to reduce locking in normal operation.
    --
    -- If the version number explicitly returned is still the same, Orleans interprets it so the update did not succeed
    -- and throws an InconsistentStateException.
