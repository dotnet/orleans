# Client Configuration

A client for connecting to a cluster of silos and sending requests to grains is configured programmatically via a `ClientBuilder` and a number of supplemental option classes.
Like silo options, client option classes follow the [ASP.NET Options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options).

There are several key aspects of client configuration:

* Orleans clustering information
* Clustering provider
* Application parts

Example of a client configuration:

``` csharp
var client = new ClientBuilder()
    // Clustering information
    .Configure<ClusterOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.ClusterId = "my-first-cluster";
        options.ServiceId = "MyAwesomeOrleansService";
    })
    // Clustering provider
    .UseAzureStorageClustering(options => options.ConnectionString = connectionString)
    // Application parts: just reference one of the grain interfaces that we use
    .ConfigureApplicationParts(parts => parts.AddApplicationPart(typeof(IValueGrain).Assembly))
    .Build();
```

Let's breakdown the steps used in this sample:

## Orleans clustering information

``` csharp
    [...]
    // Clustering information
    .Configure<ClusterOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.ClusterId = "orleans-docker";
        options.ServiceId = "AspNetSampleApp";
    })
    [...]
```

Here we set two things:
- the `ClusterId` to `"my-first-cluster"`: this is a unique ID for the Orleans cluster. All clients and silo that uses this ID will be able to directly talk to each other. Some will choose to use a different `ClusterId` for each deployments for example.
- the `ServiceId` to `"AspNetSampleApp"`: this is a unique ID for your application, that will be used by some provider (for example for persistence providers). **This ID should be stable (not change) accross deployments**.

## Clustering provider

``` csharp
    [...]
    // Clustering provider
    .UseAzureStorageClustering(options => options.ConnectionString = connectionString)
    [...]
```

The client will discover all gateway available in the cluster using this provider. Several providers are available, here in this sample we use the Azure Table provider.

## Application parts

``` csharp
    [...]
    // Application parts: just reference one of the grain interfaces that we use
    .ConfigureApplicationParts(parts => parts.AddApplicationPart(typeof(IValueGrain).Assembly)).WithReferences())
    [...];
```
