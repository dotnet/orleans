<p class="lead">
    Orleans is a framework that provides a straightforward approach to building distributed high-scale computing applications, without the need to learn and apply complex concurrency or other scaling patterns.
    It was created by Microsoft Research and designed for use in the cloud.
</p>

<p class="lead">
    Orleans has been used extensively in Microsoft Azure by several Microsoft product groups, most notably by 343 Industries as a platform for all of Halo 4 and Halo 5 cloud services, as well as by a growing number of other companies.

        <h3>Scalable by Default</h3>

        Orleans handles the complexity of building distributed systems, enabling your application
        to scale to hundreds of servers.

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>Low Latency</h3>

        Orleans allows you to keep the state you need in memory, so your application can rapidly respond
        to incoming requests.
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>Simplified Concurrency</h3>

        Orleans allows you to write simple, single threaded C# code, handling concurrency with asynchronous
        message passing between objects (grains).
