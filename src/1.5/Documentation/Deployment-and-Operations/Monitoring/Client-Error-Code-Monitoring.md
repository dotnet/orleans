# Client Error Code Monitoring

Group  | Log Type  | Log Code Values  | Threshold  | Description
-------| --------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -----------
Azure Problems  | Warning or Error  | 100800 - 100899  | Any Error or Warning  | Transient problems reading or writing to Azure table store will be logged as Warning. Transient read errors will automatically be retried. A final Error log message means there is a real problem connecting to Azure table storage.
Gateway connectivity problems | Warning or Error | 100901 - 100904, 100912, 100913, 100921, 100923, 100158, 100161, 100178, , 101313 | Any Error or Warning | Problems connecting to gateways. No active gateways in the Azure table. Connection to active gateway lost.
Grain call timeouts | Warning | 100157 | Multiple Warnings logged in short space of time | Grain-call timeout problems are generally caused by temporary network connectivity issues or silo restart / reboot problems. System should recover after a short time (depending on Liveness config settings) at which point Timeouts should clear. Ideally, monitoring for just the bulk log code 600157 variety of these warnings should be sufficient.
Network Socket Problems | Warning or Error | 101000 to 101999, 100307, 100015, 100016 | Any Error or Warning | Socket disconnects are logged as Warning messages. Problems opening sockets or during message transmission are logged as Errors.
Bulk log message compaction | Any | 500000 or higher | Message summary based on bulk message threshold settings | If multiple logs of the same log code occur within a designated time interval (the default is >5 within 1 minute) then additional log messages with that log code are suppressed and output as a "bulk" entry with log code equal to the original log code + 500000. So for example, multiple 100157 entries will show in the logs as 5 x 100157 + 1 x 600157 log entry per minute.
