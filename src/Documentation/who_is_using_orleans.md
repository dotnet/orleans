# Who Is Using Orleans?

Orleans has been used extensively by several Microsoft projects and product groups,
most notably by 343 Industries as a platform for all of Halo 4 and Halo 5 cloud services.

There are various other internal projects at Microsoft which are using Orleans, but we are not able to talk publicly about many of those yet.

There are many more companies and projects which are also using Orleans, and this page provides a partial list of some that we know about....
