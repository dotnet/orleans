# Orleans Azure Queue Streams Implementation Details

Each stream provider (Azure Queues, EventHub, SMS, SQS, ...) has it's own queue specific details and configuration.
This section provides some details about the usage, configuration and implementation of **Orleans Azure Queue Streams**.
This section is not comprehensive, and more details are available in the streaming tests, which contain most of the configuration options, specifically [**`AQClientStreamTests`**](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/test/Extensions/TesterAzureUtils/Streaming/AQClientStreamTests.cs), [**`AQSubscriptionMultiplicityTests`**](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/test/Extensions/TesterAzureUtils/Streaming/AQSubscriptionMultiplicityTests.cs), and the extension functions for [**`IAzureQueueStreamConfigurator`**](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/src/Azure/Orleans.Streaming.AzureStorage/Providers/Streams/AzureQueue/AzureQueueStreamBuilder.cs)  and [**`ISiloPersistentStreamConfigurator`**](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/src/Orleans.Runtime.Abstractions/Streams/ISiloPersistentStreamConfigurator.cs).

## Overview

Orleans Azure Queue requires the package **Microsoft.Orleans.Streaming.AzureStorage**.
The package contains - in addition to the implementation - also some extension methods that make the configuration at silo startup easier.
The minimal configuration requires at least to specify the connection string, as example:

``` csharp
hostBuilder
  .AddAzureQueueStreams<AzureQueueDataAdapterV2>("AzureQueueProvider", optionsBuilder => optionsBuilder.Configure(options => {
    options.ConnectionString = "xxx";
  }))
  // a PubSubStore could be needed, as example Azure Table Storage
  .AddAzureTableGrainStorage("PubSubStore", options => {
    options.ConnectionString = "xxx";
  })
```

The pulling agents will pull repeatedly until there are no more messages on a queue, then **delay** for a configurable period before continuing to pull. This process occurs for **each queue**.
Internally the pulling agents place messages in a **cache** (one cache per queue) for delivery to consumers, but will stop reading if the cache fills up. 
Messages are removed from the cache once consumers process the messages, so the read rate should roughly be throttled by the processing rate of the consumers.

By default it uses **8 queues** (see [**`AzureQueueOptions`**](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/src/Azure/Orleans.Streaming.AzureStorage/Providers/Streams/AzureQueue/AzureQueueStreamOptions.cs)) and 8 related pulling agents, a delay of **100ms** (see [**`StreamPullingAgentOptions.GetQueueMsgsTimerPeriod`**](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/src/Orleans.Core/Streams/PersistentStreams/Options/PersistentStreamProviderOptions.cs)) and a cache size (`IQueueCache`) of **4096 messages** (see [**`SimpleQueueCacheOptions.CacheSize`**](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/src/OrleansProviders/Streams/Common/SimpleCache/SimpleQueueCacheOptions.cs)).

## Configuration

The default configuration should fit a production environment, but for special needs it's possible to configure the default behaviour.
As example, in a development machine it's possible to reduce the number of the pulling agents to using just one queue.
This can help to reduce CPU usage and resource pressure.

``` csharp
hostBuilder
  .AddAzureQueueStreams<AzureQueueDataAdapterV2>("AzureQueueProvider", optionsBuilder => optionsBuilder.Configure(options => {
    options.ConnectionString = "xxx";
    options.QueueNames = new List<string> { "yourprefix-azurequeueprovider-0" };
  }))
```
