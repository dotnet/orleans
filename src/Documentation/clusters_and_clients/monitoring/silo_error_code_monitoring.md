# Silo Error Code Monitoring

Group  | Log Type  | Log Code Values  | Threshold  | Description
-------| --------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -----------
Azure Problems  | Warning or Error  | 100800 - 100899  |Any Error or Warning  | Transient problems reading or writing to Azure table store will be logged as Warning. Transient read errors will automatically be retried. A final Error log message means there is a real problem connecting to Azure table storage.
Membership Connectivity Problems  | Warning or Error  | 100600 - 100699  | Any Error or Warning | Warning logs are an early indication of network connectivity problems and/or silo restart / migration. Ping timeouts and silo-dead votes will show up as Warning messages. Silo detesting it was voted dead will show as Error message.
Grain call timeouts  | Warning  | 100157  | Multiple Warnings logged in short space of time | Grain-call timeout problems are generally caused by temporary network connectivity issues or silo restart / reboot problems. The system should recover after a short time (depending on Liveness config settings) at which point Timeouts should clear. Ideally, monitoring for just the bulk log code 600157 variety of these warnings should be sufficient.
Silo Restart / Migration  | Warning | 100601 or 100602  | Any Warning  | Warning printed when silo detects it was restarted on same machine {100602) or migrated to different machine (100601)  
Network Socket Problems  |Warning or Error  |101000 to 101999, 100307,100015, 100016  |Any Error or Warning | Socket disconnects are logged as Warning messages. Problems opening sockets or during message transmission are logged as Errors.
Grain problems | Warning or Error | 101534 | Any Error or Warning | Detection of “stuck” requests for non-reentrant grains . The error code is reported every time a request takes longer than 5x request timeout time to execute.
