# Hello World

In this sample, a client connects with a grain, sends it a greeting and receives a greeting back.
The client then prints that greeting and that's that.
Simple enough in theory, but since there's distribution involved, there's a bit more to it.

There are four projects involved -- one for declaring the grain interfaces, one for the grain implementations, and one for the client, one for the silo host

There's one grain interface, in IHello.cs:

``` csharp
public interface IHello : Orleans.IGrainWithIntegerKey
{
   Task<string> SayHello(string greeting);
}
```

This is simple enough, and we can see that all replies must be represented as a Task or Task<T> in communication interfaces.
The implementation, found in HelloGrain.cs, is similarly trivial:

``` csharp
public class HelloGrain : Orleans.Grain, HelloWorldInterfaces.IHello
{
    Task<string> HelloWorldInterfaces.IHello.SayHello(string greeting)
    {
        return Task.FromResult("You said: '" + greeting + "', I say: Hello!");
    }
}
```

The class inherits from the base class `Grain`, and implements the communication interface defined earlier.
Since there is nothing that the grain needs to wait on, the method is not declared `async` and instead returns its value using `Task.FromResult()`.

 The client, which orchestrates the grain code and is found in OrleansClient project, looks like this:

``` csharp
//configure the client with proper cluster options, logging and clustering
 client = new ClientBuilder()
   .UseLocalhostClustering()
   .Configure<ClusterOptions>(options =>
   {
       options.ClusterId = "dev";
       options.ServiceId = "HelloWorldApp";
   })
   .ConfigureLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
   .Build();

//connect the client to the cluster, in this case, which only contains one silo
await client.Connect();
...
// example of calling grains from the initialized client
var friend = client.GetGrain<IHello>(0);
var response = await friend.SayHello("Good morning, my friend!");
Console.WriteLine("\n\n{0}\n\n", response);
```

The silo host, which configures and starts the silo, in SiloHost project looks like this:

``` csharp
 //define the cluster configuration
var builder = new SiloHostBuilder()
//configure the cluster with local host clustering
    .UseLocalhostClustering()
    .Configure<ClusterOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.ClusterId = "dev";
        options.ServiceId = "HelloWorldApp";
    })
    .Configure<EndpointOptions>(options => options.AdvertisedIPAddress = IPAddress.Loopback)
    .ConfigureLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole());
//build the silo
var host = builder.Build();
//start the silo
await host.StartAsync();
```

To run the sample, start the silo program first, wait until silo successfully starts, which is normally just a couple seconds, and start the client program.
The client prograin will connect with the silo, then calling IHello grain.
You should see the greeting IHello grain send back printed on the console.
