## [v1.3.0](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v1.3.0) October 11th 2016

### Release notes

**NB: There is a subtle breaking change in this release, which is unfortunately easy to miss.**
*If you are using `AzureSilo.Start(ClusterConfiguration config, string deploymentId)` in your code, that overload is gone now, but the new one that replaced it has the same argument signature with a different second argument: `ClusterConfiguration config, string connectionString)`. Deployment ID now has to be passed as part of the `config` argument: config.Globals.DeploymentId. This removed the ambiguous possibility of passing two different Deployment IDs, but unfortunately at the cost of the breaking API change.*

* Bug fixes
  * Empty deployment Id in Azure [#2230](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2230/)
  * Remove zero length check in Protobuf serializer [#2251](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2251/)
  * Make PreferLocalPlacement revert to RandomPlacement on non-active silos [#2276](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2276/)
* Streaming
  * Updated MemoryStreamProvider to support custom message serialization [#2271](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2271/)

## [v1.2.4](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v1.2.4) October 5th 2016

### Release notes

Bug fix: Prevent null reference exception after clearing PubSubRendezvousGrain state [#2040](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2040/)

## [v1.3.0-beta2](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v1.3.0-beta2) September 27th 2016

* Notable new features
  * Support for geo-distributed multi-cluster deployments [#1108](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1108/) [#1109](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1109/) [#1800](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1800/)
  * Added new Amazon AWS basic Orleans providers [#2006](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/issues/2006)
  * Support distributed cancellation tokens in grain methods [#1599](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1599/)
* Providers
  * Remove confusing parameter from AzureSilo.Start [#2109](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2109/)
  * Minimal Service Fabric integration [#2120](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2120/)
  * Update blob storage provider to throw on storage exceptions [#1902](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1902/)
  * Decode protobuf using MessageParser, not dynamic [#2136](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2136/)
  * Service Provider is no longer required by EventHubAdapter [#2044](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2044/)
  * Preliminary relational persistence queries [#1682](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1682/)
  * Add a function that checks the connection string for use during initialization [#1987](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1987/) 
  * A new ADO.NET storage provider that is significantly easier to setup, which replaces the the previous one. This change is not backwards compatible and does not support sharding
  (likely be replaced later with Orleans sharding provider). The most straightforward migration plan is likely to persist the state classes from Orleans application code.

  * Add dynamic adding / removing stream providers functionality. [#1966](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1966/)

  * Do not require explicitly registering grains in ServiceCollection [#1901](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1901/) 
  * ClusterConfiguration extension for setting Startup class [#1842](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1842/)

## [v1.0.9](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v1.0.9) July 15th  2015

### This release includes several significant API changes that require adjustments in existing code created with v1.0.8 or earlier versions of Orleans  ###

**1. `GrainFactory` is not a static class anymore, so that the default implementation can be substituted for testing and other reasons.**

Within grain code one can still use code like `GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey)` because `Grain` class now has a `GrainFactory` property, which makes the above code translate to `base.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey)`. So no change is necessary for such code.

Within the client (frontend) context the default `GrainFactory` is available as a property on the `GrainClient` class. So, the code that used to be `GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey)` needs to be changed to `GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey)`

**2. `Read/Write/ClearStateAsync` methods methods that on grain state were moved from state objects to `Grain` class**

Wherever you have grain code like `this.State.WriteStateAsync()`, it needs to change to `this.WriteStateAsync()`. Similar adjustments need to be made to usage of `ReadeStateAsync()` and `CleareStateAsync()`.

**3. Binaries have been removed from the Orleans SDK**

If your projects still reference those binaries directly from the SDK folder, you need to switch to using [NuGet packages](Installation/Nugets.md) instead. If you are already consuming Orleans via NuGet, you are good.

**4. Local Silo test environment has been removed from the Orleans SDK**

If you were using the Local Silo environment from the SDK folder for testing your grains, you need to add a silo host project to your solution using the "Orleans Dev/Test Host" Visual Studio project template. Before you do that, make sure you install the [v1.0.9 version of the SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/download/v1.0.9/orleans_setup.msi). Refer to [samples](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/Samples) for examples of how that is done.

### Release notes

* Graceful shutdown of a silo with deactivation of all grains hosted in it.
* Support for Dependency Injection and better testability of grains:
	* Direct instantiation of grains with passing `IGrainIdentity` and `IGrainRuntime` to constructor.
	* `IGrainRuntime` is a mockable interface that includes a set of system service interfaces, also mockable.
	* `GrainFactory` is a non-static class that is accessed via `base.GrainFactory`  from within a grain and via  `GrainClient.GrainFactory`  on the client.
* Deprecated generated per-interface `GetGrain()` static factory methods.
* Added support for concrete grain state classes, deprecated grain state interfaces and code generation of grain classes.
* Removed `Read/Write/ClearStateAsync` methods from `IGrainState` and moved them to `Grain<T>`.
* Performance optimizations of messaging with up to 40% improvements in throughput.
* Added ZooKeeper based cluster membership storage option.
* Removed compile time dependency on Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime.dll.
* Consolidated dependencies on Azure in OrleansAzureUtils.dll, which is now optional.
* Refactored SQL system store to be more robust and vendor agnostic.
* Added streaming event deliver policy and failure reporting.
* Changed VS project templates to use only NuGet packages and not the SDK.
* Removed binaries and local silo environment from the SDK.
* Numerous bug fixes and other improvements.

## [v1.0.8](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v1.0.8) May 26th  2015

* Added version to SDK msi product and folder name.
* Other fixes and improvements.

## Orleans Open Source v1.0 Update (January 2015)

###Initial stable production-quality release.

Since the September 2014 Preview Update we have made a small number of public API changes, mainly related to clean up and more consistent naming. Those changes are summarized below:

### Public Type Names Changes

Old API   | New API
------------- | -------------
OrleansLogger | Logger
OrleansClient | GrainClient
Grain.ActivateAsync | Grain.OnActivateAsync
Grain.DeactivateAsync | Grain.OnDeactivateAsync
Orleans.Host.OrleansSiloHost | Orleans.Runtime.Host.SiloHost
Orleans.Host.OrleansAzureSilo | Orleans.Runtime.Host.AzureSilo
Orleans.Host.OrleansAzureClient| Orleans.Runtime.Host.zureClient
Orleans.Providers.IOrleansProvider | Orleans.Providers.IProvider
Orleans.Runtime.ActorRuntimeException | Orleans.Runtime.OrleansException
OrleansConfiguration | ClusterConfiguration
LoadAwarePlacementAttribute | ActivationCountBasedPlacementAttribute

### Other Changes

* All grain placement attribute (including [`StatelessWorker`]) now need to be defined on grain implementation class, rather than on grain interface.
* `LocalPlacementAttribute` was removed. There are now only `StatelessWorker` and `PreferLocalPlacement`.
* Support for Reactive programming with Async RX.
* Orleans NuGet packages are now published on NuGet.org.
  See this wiki page for advice on how to [convert legacy Orleans grain interface / class projects over to using NuGet packages](Convert-Orleans-v0.9-csproj-to-Use-v1.0-NuGet.md).
