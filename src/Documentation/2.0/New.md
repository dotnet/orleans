# What's new in Orleans 2.0

2.0 is a major release of Orleans with the main goal of making it .NET Standard 2.0 compatible and cross-platform (via .NET Core). As part of that effort, several modernizations of Orleans APIs were made to make it more aligned with how technologies like ASP.NET are configured and hosted today.

2.0 also includes a beta version of support for ACID distributed cross-grain transactions. The functionality will be ready for prototyping and development, and will graduate for production use sometime after 2.0 release.
