Project "Orleans" v1.0 January 2015
==========================================

What is Orleans?
----------------
https://github.com/dotnet/Orleans

Orleans is a framework for building highly-scalable services for cloud and on-premise deployment.
Its programming model assumes much of the burden involved in developing, deploying, 
and operating a highly scalable application running on potentially unreliable servers. 
Orleans provides a higher-level programming model, significantly reducing the amount of work 
that developers need to do while easing the transition from desktop or client/server systems 
to cloud-scale distributed applications.
