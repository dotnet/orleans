# Server Configuration

A silo is configured programmatically via a `SiloHostBuilder` and a number of supplemental option classes.
Option classes in Orleans follow the [ASP.NET Options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options) pattern, and can be loaded via files, environment variables etc. Please refer to the [Options pattern documentation]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options)) for more information.

There are several key aspects of silo configuration:

* Orleans clustering information
* Clustering provider
* Endpoints to use for silo-to-silo and client-to-silo communications
* Application parts

Example of a silo configuration that defines cluster information, uses Azure clustering and configure the application parts:

``` csharp
var silo = new SiloHostBuilder()
    // Clustering information
    .Configure<ClusterOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.ClusterId = "my-first-cluster";
        options.ServiceId = "MyAwesomeOrleansService";
    })
    // Clustering provider
    .UseAzureStorageClustering(options => options.ConnectionString = connectionString)
    // Endpoints
    .ConfigureEndpoints(siloPort: 11111, gatewayPort: 30000)
    // Application parts: just reference one of the grain implementations that we use
    .ConfigureApplicationParts(parts => parts.AddApplicationPart(typeof(ValueGrain).Assembly).WithReferences())
    // Now create the silo!
    .Build();
```

Let's breakdown the steps used in this sample:

## Orleans clustering information

``` csharp
    [...]
    // Clustering information
    .Configure<ClusterOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.ClusterId = "orleans-docker";
        options.ServiceId = "AspNetSampleApp";
    })
    [...]
```

Here we set two things:
- the `ClusterId` to `"my-first-cluster"`: this is a unique ID for the Orleans cluster. All clients and silo that uses this ID will be able to directly talk to each other. Some will choose to use a different `ClusterId` for each deployments for example.
- the `ServiceId` to `"AspNetSampleApp"`: this is a unique ID for your application, that will be used by some provider (for example for persistence providers). **This ID should be stable (not change) accross deployments**.

## Clustering provider

``` csharp
    [...]
    // Clustering provider
    .UseAzureStorageClustering(options => options.ConnectionString = connectionString)
    [...]
```

 Usually, a service built on Orleans is deployed on a cluster of nodes, either on dedicated hardware or in Azure. For development and basic testing, Orleans can be deployed in a single node configuration. When deployed to a cluster of nodes, Orleans internally implements a set of protocols to discover and maintain membership of Orleans silos in the cluster, including detection of node failures and automatic reconfiguration.

 For reliable management of cluster membership, Orleans uses Azure Table, SQL Server or Apache ZooKeeper for synchronization of nodes.

 In this sample we are using Azure Table as the membership provider.

## Endpoints

``` csharp
var silo = new SiloHostBuilder()
    [...]
    // Endpoints
    .ConfigureEndpoints(siloPort: 11111, gatewayPort: 30000)
    [...]
```

An Orleans silo typically configure two endpoints:

* the silo-to-silo endpoints, used for communication between silo in the same cluster
* the client-to-silo endpoints (or gateway), use for communication between clients and silos in the same cluster.

In the sample we are using the helper method `.ConfigureEndpoints(siloPort: 11111, gatewayPort: 30000)` that set the port used for silo-to-silo communication and the port for the gateway to `11111` and `30000` respectively. This method will detect on which interface listen.

This method should be sufficient in most cases, but you can customize it further if you need it. Here is for example if you want to use an external IP address with some port-forwarding:

``` csharp
[...]
.Configure<EndpointOptions>(options =>
{
    // Port to use for Silo-to-Silo
    options.SiloPort = 11111;
    // Port to use for the gateway
    options.GatewayPort = 30000;
    // IP Address to advertise in the cluster
    options.AdvertisedIPAddress = IPAddress.Parse("172.16.0.42");
    // The socket used for silo-to-silo will bing to this endpoint
    options.GatewayListeningEndpoint = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, 40000);
    // The socket used by the gateway will bing to this endpoint
    options.SiloListeningEndpoint = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, 50000);

})
[...]
```

Internally, the silo will listen on `0.0.0.0:40000` and `0.0.0.0:50000` but the value published in the membership provider will be `172.16.0.42:11111` and ``172.16.0.42:30000`.

## Application parts

``` csharp
    [...]
    // Application parts: just reference one of the grain implementations that we use
    .ConfigureApplicationParts(parts => parts.AddApplicationPart(typeof(ValueGrain).Assembly).WithReferences())
    [...];
```

Although this step is not technically required (if not configured, Orleans will scan all assembly in the current folder), developers are encouraged to configure this. This step will help Orleans to load user assemblies and types. These assemblies are referred to as Application Parts.
All Grains, Grain Interfaces, and Serializers are discovered using Application Parts.

Application Parts are configured using an `IApplicationPartsManager`, which can be accessed using the `ConfigureApplicationParts` extension method on `IClientBuilder` and `ISiloHostBuilder`. The `ConfigureApplicationParts` method accepts a delegate, `Action<IApplicationPartManager>`.

The following extension methods on `IApplicationPartManager` support common uses:
* `AddApplicationPart(assembly)` a single assembly can be added using this extension method.
* `AddFromAppDomain()` adds all assemblies currently loaded in the `AppDomain`.
* `AddFromApplicationBaseDirectory()` loads and adds all assemblies in the current base path (see `AppDomain.BaseDirectory`).

Assemblies added by the above methods can be supplemented using the following extension methods on their return type, `IApplicationPartManagerWithAssemblies`:
* `WithReferences()` adds all referenced assemblies from the added parts. This immediately loads any transitively referenced assemblies. Assembly loading errors are ignored.
* `WithCodeGeneration()` generates support code for the added parts and adds it to the part manager. Note that this requires the `Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansCodeGenerator` package to be installed, and is commonly referred to as runtime code generation.

Type discovery requires that the provided Application Parts include specific attributes. Adding the build-time code generation package (`Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansCodeGenerator.Build`) to each project containing Grains, Grain Interfaces, or Serializers is the recommended approach for ensuring that these attributes are present. Build-time code generation only supports C#. For F#, Visual Basic, and other .NET languages, code can be generated during configuration time via the `WithCodeGeneration()` method described above.
