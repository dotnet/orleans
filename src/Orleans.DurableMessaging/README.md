# Microsoft Orleans Durable Messaging

This project supplies the durable messaging protocol and handler-routing contracts:

- `DurableEnvelope` identifies a message by sender and message ID and carries its
  destination, route, correlation key, reply destination, and creation timestamp.
- `DurableEnvelopeBuilder` serializes the body and each request-context value into
  an envelope buffer. `DurableEnvelopeData` supports deferred typed reads and raw
  byte access, preserving declared type metadata across serialization and copying.
- `HierarchicalKey` provides escaped, slash-separated correlation keys with
  segment-aware parent, child, and ancestor comparisons.
- `IDurableInbox`, `IDurableOutbox`, and `IDurableInboxExtension` define message
  registration, inspection, enqueue, and delivery operations. `DeliveryResult` and
  `DeliveryStatus` describe delivery outcomes.
- `IInboxHandler` and `IInboxHandler<TMessage>` define metadata selection and
  `PrepareAsync`, which returns a `ValueTask<Action>` for synchronous application.
  `RouteKeyHandler`, `RoutePrefixHandler`, and `CorrelationHandler` match exact ordinal
  routes, route prefixes at segment boundaries, and correlation
  hierarchies. `IInboxHandlerContext` exposes the envelope and outbound-message helpers.
- `DurableInboxOptions` supplies defaults and validates capacity, retry, retention,
  and batch limits, including an outbox retry age shorter than the deduplication window.

Handlers perform validation, asynchronous I/O, and envelope serialization using local
values during preparation. They return a non-null synchronous action which applies
already-prepared business mutations and stages prepared messages using the existing
`Send` method. Messaging invokes that action once for the prepared attempt. An attempt
with no effects returns an empty synchronous action. Each applied effect is already
safe to commit with the shared pending journal changes.

This intermediate project is non-packable while the runtime and hosting layers are
assembled into `Microsoft.Orleans.DurableMessaging`.
