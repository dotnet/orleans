# Microsoft Orleans Durable Messaging

This project supplies the durable messaging protocol, handler routing, and journaled inbox runtime:

- `DurableEnvelope` identifies a message by sender and message ID and carries its
  destination, route, correlation key, reply destination, and creation timestamp.
- `DurableEnvelopeBuilder` serializes the body and each request-context value into
  an envelope buffer. `DurableEnvelopeData` supports deferred typed reads and raw
  byte access, preserving declared type metadata across serialization and copying.
- `HierarchicalKey` provides escaped, slash-separated correlation keys with
  segment-aware parent, child, and ancestor comparisons.
- `IDurableInbox`, `IDurableOutbox`, and `IDurableInboxExtension` define message
  registration, inspection, enqueue, and delivery operations. `DeliveryResult` and
  `DeliveryStatus` describe delivery outcomes.
- `IInboxHandler` and `IInboxHandler<TMessage>` define metadata selection and
  `PrepareAsync`, which returns a `ValueTask<Action>` for synchronous application.
  `RouteKeyHandler`, `RoutePrefixHandler`, and `CorrelationHandler` match exact ordinal
  routes, route prefixes at segment boundaries, and correlation
  hierarchies. `IInboxHandlerContext` exposes the envelope and outbound-message helpers.
- `DurableInboxOptions` supplies defaults and validates capacity, retry, retention,
  and batch limits, including an outbox retry age shorter than the deduplication window.

The inbox accepts a message after DurableJobs confirms scheduling and the journal
commits the envelope together with its ownership generation and exact returned job
handle. Recovery restores that pair and repairs an absent owner for pending work.
Callbacks validate generation and physical job identity before processing.

Handlers execute sequentially. Their journaled effects, staged output, inbox
completion, and `(SenderId, MessageId)` deduplication record commit together after
the handler returns. A failed handler restores committed state and applies bounded
retry and dead-letter policy. Retained duplicates return `Duplicate`; expiry permits
acceptance again. Capacity limits return `Backpressured` before persistence.
Exact route registration retains the original handler instance and takes precedence
over generic handler selection. Operational diagnostics expose retained dead letters
and stage their removal for the next journal write.

This intermediate project remains non-packable. Receiver tests compose the runtime
with existing Journaling and DurableJobs services using test-only registration;
outbound dispatch and public hosting composition are assembled in later layers.
