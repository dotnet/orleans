/*
The grain directory in Orleans is a key-value store where the key is a grain identifier and the value is a registration entry which points to an active silo which (potentially)
hosts the grain.

The directory is partitioned using a consistent hash ring with ranges being assigned to the active silos in the cluster. Grain identifiers are hashed to find the silo which is
owns the section of the ring corresponding to its hash. Each active silo owns a pre-configured number of ranges, defaulting to 30 ranges per silo. This is similar to the scheme
used by Amazon Dynamo (see https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf) and Apache Cassandra (see
https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/architecture/archDataDistributeVnodesUsing.html), where multiple "virtual nodes" (ranges) are created for each node
(host). The size of a partition is determined by the distance between its hash and the hash of the next partition. Range ownership is determined by cluster membership
configuration. Cluster membership configurations are called "views" and each view has a monotonically increasing version number. As silos join and leave the cluster, successive
views are created, resulting in changes to range ownership. This is known as a view change. Directory partitions have two modes of operation: normal operation and view change.
During normal operation, directory partitions process requests locally without coordination with other hosts. During a view changes, hosts coordinate with each other to transfer
ownership of directory ranges. Once this transfer is complete, normal operation resumes. The two-phase design of the directory follows the Virtual Synchrony methodology (see
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/virtually-synchronous-methodology-for-dynamic-service-replication/) and has some similarities to Vertical Paxos (see
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/vertical-paxos-and-primary-backup-replication/). Both proceed in two phases: a normal operation phase where a fixed set of
processes handle requests without failures, and a view change phase where state and control are transferred between views during membership changes.

When a view change occurs, a partition can either grow or shrink. If a new silo has joined the cluster, then the partition may shrink to make room for the new silo's partition. If
a silo has left the cluster, then the partition may grow to take over the leaving silo's partition. When a partition shrinks, the previous owner seals the lost range and creates a
snapshot containing the directory entries in that range. The new range owner (whose partition has grown, potentially from zero) requests the snapshot from the previous owner and
applies it locally. Once the snapshot has been applied, the new owner can begin servicing requests. The new owner acknowledges the transfer to the previous owner so the previous
owner can delete the snapshot. The previous owner also deletes the snapshot if it sees that the snapshot transfer has been abandoned.

When a host crashes without first handing off its directory partitions, the hosts which subsequently own the partitions previously owned by the crashed silo must perform recovery.
Recovery involves asking every active silo in the cluster for the grain registrations they own. Registrations for evicted silos do not need to be recovered, since registrations are
only valid for active silos. The recovery procedure ensures that there is no data loss and that the directory remains consistent (no duplicate grain activations).

Cluster membership guarantees monotonicity, but it does not guarantee that all silos see all membership views: it is possible for silos to skip intermediate membership view, for
example if membership changes rapidly. When this happens, snapshot transfers are abandoned and recovery must be performed instead of the normal partition-to-partition hand-over,
since the silo does not know with certainty which partition was the previous owner. A future improvement to cluster membership may reduce or eliminate this scenario by ensuring
that all views are seen by all silos.

Directory partitions (implemented in GrainDirectoryPartition) use versioned range locks to prevent invalid access to ranges during view changes. Range locks are created during
view change and are released when the view change is complete. These locks are analogous to the 'wedges' used in the Virtual Synchrony methodology. It is possible for a range to
be split among multiple silos during a view change. This adds some complexity to the view change procedure since each partition must potentially coordinate with multiple other
partitions to complete the view change.

All requests to a directory partition include the view number of the caller, and all responses from the directory include the view number of the directory partition. When the
directory partition sees a view number higher than its own, it refreshes its view and initiates view change. Similarly, when a caller sees a response with a higher view number
than its own, it refreshes its view and retries the request if necessary. This ensures that all requests are processed by the correct owner of the directory partition.
