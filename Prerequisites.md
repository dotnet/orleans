Orleans is a set of .NET libraries. In order to use Orleans, you need [.NET Framework](http://www.microsoft.com/net) 4.5 or higher and a copy of [Visual Studio 2013](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd831853.aspx). Trial versions of Visual Studio are available at [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dn369242#fbid=S8c2-uibvsG). Note that the Express versions of Visual Studio do not support extension packages. We did not test Orleans with [Visual Studio 2015 Preview](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2015-preview-vs.aspx).

An Azure subscription is not required but that's the easiest way to use Orleans in the cloud. Azure is available as a [free trial](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/). Current version of Orleans has been compiled and tested with [Azure SDK for .NET](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) 2.4 and 2.5.
