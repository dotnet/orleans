Orleans is a set of .NET libraries. In order to use Orleans, you need [.NET Framework](http://www.microsoft.com/net) 4.5 or higher and a copy of [Visual Studio 2013 or 2015](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd831853.aspx). Trial versions of Visual Studio are available at [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dn369242#fbid=S8c2-uibvsG). Note that the Express versions of Visual Studio does not support extension packages.

An Azure subscription is not required but that's the easiest way to use Orleans in the cloud. Azure is available as a [free trial](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/). Current version of Orleans has been compiled and tested with [Azure SDK for .NET](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) 2.4 - 2.7.
