1. The silo that shuts down should broadcast notification about this 
(provided RuntimeTimeouts.LIVENESS_DO_GOSSIP_OPTIMIZATION is enabled).
Currently, notifications are sent when a new silo joins or when some silo was actively marked as being dead.

2. Decide about the list of watchers based on sorted order of *hashed* silo adderesses 
(currently, it is the sorted order of silo addresses converted to string).
This requires just one line of code change in UpdateListOfProbedSilos():
instead of  
	tmpList.Sort((x, y) => x.ToString().CompareTo(y.ToString()));   
it should be
	tmpList.Sort((x, y) => x.GetConsistentHashCode().CompareTo(y.GetConsistentHashCode()));

3. When trying to vote for a failed silo in IncFailedProbes(), consider retrying if the conditional 
write to the table fails due to concurrent write of another silos.
