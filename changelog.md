# Microsoft Orleans Changelog
All notable end-user facing changes are documented in this file.

### [vNext]
*Here are all the changes in `master` branch, and will be moved to the appropriate release once they are included in a published nuget package.
The idea is to track end-user facing changes as they occur.*
- Several major performance improvements
- Add streaming support for types that are serialized using IExternalSerializers

### [v1.3.1]
- Improvements
  - Ability to specify interleaving per message type (was needed for Orleankka) #2246
  - Support serialization of enums backed by non-Int32 fields #2237 
  - Add TGrainState constraints to document clearly what is needed by folks implementing stateful grains. #1923
  - Serialization fixes #2295
  - Update OrleansConfiguration.xsd with DI info #2314
  - Reroute client messages via a different gateway upon a gateway disconnection #2298
  - Add helper methods to ease ADO.NET configuration #2291
  - EventHubStreamProvider improvements #2377
  - Add queue flow controller that is triggered by silo load shedding. #2378
  - Modify JenkinsHash to be stateless. #2403
  - EventHub flow control customization knobs #2408
- Performance
  - Invoker codegen: methods returning Task<object> do not need Box() calls #2221
  - CodeGen: Avoid wrapping IGrainMethodInvoker.Invoke body in try/catch #2220
  - Remove contention point in GrainDirectoryPartition #2170
  - Optimize the scheduler, remove redundant semaphore and interlocked exchange. #2218
  - Remove delegate allocation #2312
  - Release BinaryTokenStreamWriter buffers after use in more cases. #2326
  - Provide better handling in Grain when the GrainRuntime or GrainIdentity is null #2338
- Bug fixes
  - Reset client gateway reciever buffer on socket reset. #2316
  - Removes potential deadlocking and corrupted hashing in ADO.NET storage provider #2395
  - LoadShedQueueFlowControl cast fix #2405

### [v1.3.0]
- Bug fixes:
  - Ignore empty deployment Id in Azure #2230 
  - Remove zero length check in Protobuf serializer #2251 
  - Make PreferLocalPlacement revert to RandomPlacement on non-active silos #2276 
- Updated MemoryStreamProvider to support custom message serialization #2271 

### [v1.3.0-beta2]
- Support for geo-distributed multi-cluster deployments #1108 #1109 #1800
- Providers
  - Remove confusing parameter from AzureSilo.Start #2109
  - Minimal Service Fabric integration #2120
  - Update blob storage provider to throw on storage exceptions #1902
  - Decode protobuf using MessageParser, not dynamic #2136
  - Service Provider is no longer required by EventHubAdapter #2044
  - Preliminary relational persistence queries #1682
  - Add a function that checks the connection string for use during initialization #1987
  - Added new Amazon AWS basic Orleans providers [#2006](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/issues/2006)
  - A new ADO.NET storage provider that is significantly easier to setup, which replaces the the previous one. This change is not backwards compatible and does not support sharding
  (likely be replaced later with Orleans sharding provider). The most straightforward migration plan is likely to persist the state classes from Orleans application code.
  More information in [#1682](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1682) and in [#1682 (comment)](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1682#issuecomment-234371701).

  - Fixed a NullReferenceException bug in ClientObserverRegistrar. #1823
- Test
  - Allow liveness config in TestCluster #1818
  - Fix for strange bug in BondSerializer #1790
  - Some improvements for unit testing #1792 #1802
- Other
  - Move JSON serialization methods into OrleansJsonSerializer #2206

  - Moved Orleans Performance Counters into its own Telemetry Consumer. Now you need to explicitly register the `OrleansPerfCounterTelemetryConsumer` either by code or XML. More information in [#2122](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2122) and docs will come later. `Microsoft.Orleans.CounterControl` can still be used to install the performance counters or you can use `InstallUtil.exe OrleansTelemetryConsumers.Counters.dll` to install it without depending on `OrleansCounterControl.exe`
  - New PowerShell client Module #1990
  - Expose property IsLongKey for IAddressable #1939
  - Removed OrleansDependencyInjection package and instead Orleans references Microsoft.Extensions.DepedencyInjection #1911 #1901 #1878
  - Now using Microsoft.Extensions.DepedencyInjection.ServiceProvider as the default service provider if the user does not override it. Grains are still not being injected automatically unless the user opts in by specifying his own Startup configuration that returns a service provider.

### [v1.2.4]
- Bug fix: Prevent null reference exception after clearing PubSubRendezvousGrain state #2040
  
### [v1.2.3]
- Ability to force creation of Orleans serializers for types not marked with [Serializable] by using GenerateSerializer, KnownType or KnownAssembly.TreatTypesAsSerializable #1888 #1864 #1855
- Troubleshooting improvements:
  - Fixed stacktrace preservation in exceptions from grain calls (bug introduced in 1.2.0) #1879 #1808
  - Better messaging when silo fails to join due to initial connectivity problems #1866
  - Throw meaningful exception if grain timer is created outside grain context #1858
- Bug fixes:
  - Do not deactivate Stateless Workers upon grain directory partition shutdown #1838
  - interception works with Streams and grain extensions #1874
  - Memory Storage provider properly enforces etags for any state that has been added or removed, but does not enforce etags for newly added state. #1885
  - Other minor bug fixes #1823
- Known issues:
  - It is not advisable for your Orleans application to depend on WindowsAzure.Storage >= 7.0 due to #1912. This new constraint applies to previously released Orleans versions too. Will be fixed in 1.3.0.
