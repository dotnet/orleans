# Microsoft Orleans Changelog
All notable end-user facing changes are documented in this file.

### [vNext]
*Here are all the changes in `master` branch, and will be moved to the appropriate release once they are included in a published nuget package.
The idea is to track end-user facing changes as they occur.*

### [1.5.0-beta1]
- Breaking changes
  - Upgraded minimum framework dependency to .NET 4.6.1 #2945
  - Support for non-static client via ClientBuilder (although static GrainClient still works but will be removed in a future version). You can now start many clients in the same process, even if you are inside a Silo #2822.
    There are a few differences though:
    - Several changes to SerializationManager, mainly to make it non-static #2592
      - When deserializing a GrainReference from storage, you might need to re-bind it to the runtime by calling `grain.BindGrainReference(grainFactory)` on it or you would get `GrainReferenceNotBoundException` when attempting to use it #2738
      - Removed `RegisterSerializerAttribute` (and corresponding static Register method for registering a custom serializer). If you were using that, please read https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/Advanced-Concepts/Serialization.html#writing-custom-serializers for alternative ways to register your custom serializer #2941
  - Better serialization of `Type` values (but can cause compatibility issues if these were persisted by using the Serialziation Manager) #2952
  - Automatically deactivate a grain if it bubbles up `InconsistentStateException` (thrown when there is an optimistic concurrency conflict when writing to storage) #2959
  - Providers are now constructed using Dependency Injection. The result is that custom providers must have a single public constructor with either no arguments or arguments which can all be injected, or they need to be explicitly registered in the ServiceCollection. #2721 #2980
  - Change default stream subscription faulting to false in EventHub and Memory stream providers, as is in other providers #2974
  - Bug fix: Azure storage providers now throw `InconsistenStateException` instead of `StorageException` when eTags do not match #2971
- Non-breaking improvements
  - Grain interface versioning to enable no-downtime upgrades #2837 2837
  - Programmable stream subscribe API #2741 #2796 #2909
  - Support for custom placement strategies and directors #2932
  - Improvements to GrainServices API #2839
  - Replace `CallContext.LogicalSetData` with AsyncLocal #2200 #2961
  - Ability to configure `FabricClient` when deploying to Service Fabric #2954
  - Added extension points to EventHubAdapterFactory #2930
  - Added SlowConsumingPressureMonitor for EventHub streams #2873
  - Dispose all registered services in the container when shutting down #2876
  - Try to prevent port collisions when starting in-memory `TestCluster` #2779
  - Deprecated `TestingSiloHost` in favor of `TestCluster` (although the former is still available for this version) #2919
- Non-breaking bug fixes
  - Change how message expiration is handled to account for server clock skew #2922
  - Several minor bug fixes and perf improvements, as well as reliability in our test code

### [v1.4.1]
- Improvements
  - Fix a cleanup issue in TestCluster after a failure #2734
  - Remove unnecessary service registration of IServiceProvider to itself, which improves support for 3rd party containers #2749
  - Add a timeout for socket connection #2791
  - Support for string grain id in OrleansManager.exe #2815
  - Avoid reconnection to gateway no longer in the list returned by IGatewayListProvider #2824
  - Handle absolute path in IntermediateOutputPath to address issue 2864 #2865, #2871
  - Rename codegen file to be excluded from code analyzers #2872
  - ProviderTypeLoader: do not enumerate types in ReflectionOnly assembly. #2869
  - Do not throw when calling Stop on AsynchQueueAgent after it was disposed.
- Bug fixes
  - NodeConfiguration.AdditionalAssemblyDirectories was not 'deeply' copied in the copy constructor #2758
  - Fix AsReference() in generated code for null values #2756
  - Avoid a NullReferenceException in SerializationManager.Register(...) #2768
  - Fix missing check for empty deployment id #2786
  - Fix to make OrleansPerfCounterTelemetryConsumer still work for grain-specific counters. (part of #2807)
  - Fix typos in format strings #2853
  - Fix null reference exception in simple queue cache. #2829 

### [v1.4.0]
- Breaking changes
  - All grain instances and providers are constructed using the configured Dependency Injection container. The result is that all grains must have a single parameterless public constructor or single constructor with arguments which can all be injected. If no container is configured, the default container will be used. [#2485](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2485)
- Known issues
  - When the silo starts up, it will register IServiceProvider in the container, which can be a circular reference registration when using 3rd party containers such as AutoFac. This is being addressed for 1.4.1, but there is a simple workaround for it at [#2747](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/issues/2747)
  - The build-time code generator required (and automatically added) a file named `Properties\orleans.codegen.cs` to the project where codegen was being ran. The new MSBuild targets no longer do that, so when upgrading a solution with a previous version of Orleans, you can safely delete this orleans.codegen.cs file from your grain projects.

  (likely be replaced later with Orleans sharding provider). The most straightforward migration plan is likely to persist the state classes from Orleans application code.
  More information in [#1682](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1682) and in [#1682 (comment)](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/1682#issuecomment-234371701).

More information in [#2122](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/pull/2122) and docs will come later. `Microsoft.Orleans.CounterControl` can still be used to install the performance counters or you can use `InstallUtil.exe OrleansTelemetryConsumers.Counters.dll` to install it without depending on `OrleansCounterControl.exe`
  - New PowerShell client Module #1990
  - Expose property IsLongKey for IAddressable #1939
  - Removed OrleansDependencyInjection package and instead Orleans references Microsoft.Extensions.DepedencyInjection #1911 #1901 #1878

  - Throw meaningful exception if grain timer is created outside grain context #1858
- Bug fixes:
  - Do not deactivate Stateless Workers upon grain directory partition shutdown #1838
  - interception works with Streams and grain extensions #1874
  - Memory Storage provider properly enforces etags for any state that has been added or removed, but does not enforce etags for newly added state. #1885
  - Other minor bug fixes #1823
- Known issues:
  - It is not advisable for your Orleans application to depend on WindowsAzure.Storage >= 7.0 due to #1912. This new constraint applies to previously released Orleans versions too. Will be fixed in 1.3.0.
