In order to run the samples you need first to install the Orleans installer msi, as described here:
https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/wiki/Installation

If you previously used an older version of Orleans, notably 0.9 version, we reccomend first to completely uninstall it.

The installer installs the Orleans SDK in the folder pointed by [ORLEANS-SDK] environment variable and the samples find it there.
You can then build and run the samples.
