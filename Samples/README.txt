In order to run the samples you need first to install the Orleans installer msi, as described here:
https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/wiki/Installation

The installer installs the Orleans SDK in the folder pointed by [ORLEANS-SDK] environment variable and the samples find it there.
You can then build and run the samples.
