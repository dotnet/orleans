## Configuring Connections to Orleans

To allow applications to communicate with grains from outside Orleans, the framework includes a client library. 
This client library might be used by a desktop or mobile application, or by a front end server that renders interactive web pages or exposes a web services API. 
The client library provides a subset of the Orleans programming model for writing asynchronous clients that can find, create, and communicate with Orleans grains. This requires a few simple steps:

1. Connect to an Orleans gateway 
2. Find existing grains or create new ones 
3. Send messages to grains and receive responses 
4. Receive asynchronous notifications from grains via observers 

## Connecting to a Gateway

To establish a connection, a client calls `OrleansClient.Initialize()`. 
This will connect to the gateway silo at the IP address and port specified in the _ClientConfiguration.xml_ file. 
This file must be placed in the same directory as the _Orleans.dll_ library used by the client. 
As an alternative, a configuration object can be passed to `OrleansClient.Initialize()` programmatically instead of loading it from a file.

## Configuring the Client

In _ClientConfiguration.xml_, the `Gateway` element specifies the address and port of the gateway endpoint that need to match those in _OrleansConfiguration.xml_ on the silo side:

    <ClientConfiguration xmlns="urn:orleans">
       <Gateway Address="<IP address or host name of silo>" Port="30000" />
    </ClientConfiguration>

If an Orleans-based application runs in Windows Azure, the client automatically discovers silo gateways and shouldn't be statically configured. 
Refer to the [Azure application sample](../Samples-Overview/Azure-Web-Sample) for an example of how to configure the client.

## Configuring Silos

In _OrleansConfiguration.xml_, the `ProxyingGateway` element specifies the gateway endpoint of the silo, which is separate from the inter-silo endpoint defined by the Networking element and must have a different port number:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <OrleansConfiguration xmlns="urn:orleans">
      <Defaults>
        <Networking Address="" Port="11111" />
        <ProxyingGateway Address="" Port="30000" />
      </Defaults>
    </OrleansConfiguration>
