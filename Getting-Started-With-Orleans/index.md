title: Getting Started with Orleans

{% include JB/setup %}

Orleans provides a higher-level programming model than existing .NET libraries, significantly reducing the amount of work that developers need to do while easing the transition from desktop or client/server systems to cloud-scale distributed applications. Orleans programs can co-exist and communicate with existing applications, but to obtain the benefits of Orleans an application needs to be written using the Orleans programming model. Orleans applications can easily be deployed in Azure or on a private cluster.

This section provides an introduction to Orleans for developers planning to write new applications. It covers the Orleans architecture, describes the key concepts in some detail, and provides basic information on how to build, deploy, and run an Orleans application.
