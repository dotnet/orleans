    /// - Default: Turn-based concurrency (one request at a time)
    /// - [ReadOnly]: Methods can execute concurrently with other methods
    /// - [AlwaysInterleave]: All methods can interleave
    /// - [Reentrant]: Grain can process new requests while awaiting
    /// 
    /// These tests focus on [ReadOnly] methods, which allow multiple read operations
    /// to execute concurrently while maintaining data safety. This is crucial for:
    /// - Improving throughput for read-heavy workloads
    /// - Reducing latency when multiple clients read the same data
    /// - Maintaining grain state consistency
