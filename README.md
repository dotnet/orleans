Orleans is a framework that provides a straight-forward approach to building distributed high-scale computing applications, without the need to learn and apply complex concurrency or other scaling patterns. 

It was created by [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/projects/orleans/) 
implementing the [Virtual Actor Model](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=210931) 
and designed for use in the cloud. 

Orleans has been used extensively running in Microsoft Azure by several Microsoft product groups, most notably by [343 Industries](https://www.halowaypoint.com/) as a platform for all of Halo 4 and Halo 5 cloud services, as well as by [a number of other projects and companies](http://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Who-Is-Using-Orleans).

Installation
============

Installation is performed via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=orleans). 
There are several packages, one for each different project type (interfaces, grains, silo, and client).

In the grain interfaces project:
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Orleans.Templates.Interfaces
```
In the grain implementations project:
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Orleans.Templates.Grains
```
In the server (silo) project:
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Orleans.Server
```
In the client project:
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Orleans.Client
```

### Official Builds

The stable production-quality release is located [here](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/latest).

### Building From Source

Clone the sources from the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans) 

Run run the `Build.cmd` script to build the binaries locally,
then reference the required NuGet packages from `Binaries\NuGet.Packages\*`.

Documentation
=============

Documentation is located [here](http://dotnet.github.io/orleans/)

Code Examples
=============

Create an interface for your grain:
```c#
public interface IHello : Orleans.IGrainWithIntegerKey
{
  Task<string> SayHello(string greeting);
}
```

Provide an implementation of that interface:
```c#
public class HelloGrain : Orleans.Grain, IHello
{
  Task<string> SayHello(string greeting)
  {
    return Task.FromResult($"You said: '{greeting}', I say: Hello!");
  }
}
```

Call the grain from your Web service (or anywhere else):
```c#
// Get a reference to the IHello grain with id '0'.
var friend = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IHello>(0);

// Send a greeting to the grain and await the response.
Console.WriteLine(await friend.SayHello("Good morning, my friend!"));
```
