Orleans is a framework that provides a straight-forward approach to building distributed high-scale computing applications, without the need to learn and apply complex concurrency or other scaling patterns. 

It was created by [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/projects/orleans/) 
implementing the [Virtual Actor Model](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=210931) 
and designed for use in the cloud. 

Orleans has been used extensively running in Microsoft Azure by several Microsoft product groups, most notably by [343 Industries](https://www.halowaypoint.com/) as a platform for all of Halo 4 and Halo 5 cloud services, as well as by [a number of other projects and companies](http://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Community/Who-Is-Using-Orleans.html).

Installation
============

Installation is performed via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=orleans). 
There are several packages, one for each different project type (interfaces, grains, silo, and client).

In the grain interfaces project:
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Orleans.Core.Abstractions
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansCodeGenerator.Build
```
In the grain implementations project:
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Orleans.Core.Abstractions
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansCodeGenerator.Build
```
In the server (silo) project:
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Orleans.Server
```
In the client project:
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Orleans.Client
```

### Official Builds

The stable production-quality release is located [here](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/latest).

The latest clean development branch build from CI is located: [here](https://ci.dot.net/job/dotnet_orleans/job/master/job/netfx-bvt/lastStableBuild/artifact/)

Nightly builds are published to https://dotnet.myget.org/gallery/orleans-ci . These builds pass all functional tests, but are not thoroughly tested as the stable builds or pre-release builds we push to NuGet.org

To use nightly builds in your project, add the MyGet feed using either of the following methods:

1. Changing the .csproj file to include this section:

```xml
    <RestoreSources>
      $(RestoreSources);
      https://dotnet.myget.org/F/orleans-ci/api/v3/index.json;
    </RestoreSources>
```
or

2. Creating a `NuGet.config` file in the solution directory with the following contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
 <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="orleans-ci" value="https://dotnet.myget.org/F/orleans-ci/api/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="nuget" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
 </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

### Building from source

Clone the sources from the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans) 

Run the `Build.cmd` script to build the nuget packages locally,
then reference the required NuGet packages from `/Artifacts/Release/*`.
You can run `Test.cmd` to run all BVT tests, and `TestAll.cmd` to also run Functional tests (which take much longer)

### Building and running tests in Visual Studio 2017
.NET Core 2.0 SDK is a pre-requisite to build Orleans.sln.

There might be errors trying to build from Visual Studio because of conflicts with the test discovery engine (error says could not copy `xunit.abstractions.dll`).
The reason for that error is that you need to configure the test runner in VS like so (after opening the solution):
* `Test` -> `Test Settings` -> Uncheck `Keep Test Execution Engine running`
* `Test` -> `Test Settings` -> `Default Processor Architecture` -> Check `X64`

Then either restart VS, or go to the task manager and kill the processes that starts with `vstest.`. Then build once again and it should succeed and tests should appear in the `Test Explorer` window.

Documentation
=============

Documentation is located [here](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/)

Code Examples
=============

Create an interface for your grain:
```c#
public interface IHello : Orleans.IGrainWithIntegerKey
{
  Task<string> SayHello(string greeting);
}
```

Provide an implementation of that interface:
```c#
public class HelloGrain : Orleans.Grain, IHello
{
  Task<string> SayHello(string greeting)
  {
    return Task.FromResult($"You said: '{greeting}', I say: Hello!");
  }
}
```

Call the grain from your Web service (or anywhere else):
```c#
// Get a reference to the IHello grain with id '0'.
var friend = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IHello>(0);

// Send a greeting to the grain and await the response.
Console.WriteLine(await friend.SayHello("Good morning, my friend!"));
```

Blog
=========
[Orleans Blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/orleans/) is a place to share our thoughts, plans, learnings, tips and tricks, and ideas, crazy and otherwise, which donâ€™t easily fit the documentation format. We would also like to see here posts from the community members, sharing their experiences, ideas, and wisdom. 
So, welcome to Orleans Blog, both as a reader and as a blogger!
