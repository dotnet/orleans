Orleans is a framework that provides a straight-forward approach to building distributed high-scale computing applications, without the need to learn and apply complex concurrency or other scaling patterns. 
It was created by [Microsoft Research][MSR-ProjectOrleans] and designed for use in the cloud. 
Orleans has been used extensively running in Microsoft Azure by several Microsoft product groups, most notably by 343 Industries as a platform for all of Halo 4 cloud services, as well as by [a number of other projects and companies](http://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Who-Is-Using-Orleans).
